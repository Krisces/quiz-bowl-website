            <span class="label">Resistor</span> A resistor is an element that 
        impedes the flow of <span style="font-weight: bold;">current</span>, 
        creating a <span style="font-weight: bold;">voltage drop</span>. 
        Resistance is measured in <span style="font-weight: bold;">ohms
        </span>, named for <span style="font-weight: bold;">Georg Ohm
        </span> and symbolized by a capital omega (&Omega;).
    </p>
		<p class="justify">
            Resistors are governed by <span style="font-weight: bold;">
            Ohm&#8217;s law</span>, <i>V</i>&nbsp;=&nbsp;<i>I</i><i>R</i>. 
            In other words, the voltage drop across a resistor (<i>V</i>) 
            equals the current passing through the resistor (<i>I</i>) 
            times the resistor&#8217;s resistance (<i>R</i>). According to 
            <span style="font-weight: bold;">Joule&#8217;s first law</span>, 
            the <span style="font-weight: bold;">power dissipated</span> 
            by a resistor is <i>P</i>&nbsp;=&nbsp;<i>I</i><sup>2</sup>
            <i>R</i>. Combining that fact with Ohm&#8217;s law yields 
            <i>P</i>&nbsp;=&nbsp;<i>I</i><i>V</i>.
        </p>
		<p class="justify">
            The total resistance of a circuit depends on whether resistors 
            are arranged in <span style="font-weight: bold;">parallel</span> 
            (different branches connecting to the same pair of nodes) or 
            <span style="font-weight: bold;">series</span> (same branch). 
            If two resistors having resistance <i>R</i><sub>1</sub> and 
            <i>R</i><sub>2</sub> are placed in series, the total resistance 
            across them is <i>R</i>&nbsp;=&nbsp;<i>R</i><sub>1</sub>
            &nbsp;+&nbsp;<i>R</i><sub>2</sub>; if they are placed in 
            parallel, then 1/<i>R</i>&nbsp;=&nbsp;1/<i>R</i><sub>1</sub>
            &nbsp;+1/&nbsp;<i>R</i><sub>2</sub>.
        </p>
		<p class="justify">
            A <span style="font-weight: bold;">rheostat</span>, or variable 
            resistor, can be made by taking a material of uniform 
            <span style="font-weight: bold;">resistivity</span> and 
            changing how much of the material is in the circuit. A 
            <span style="font-weight: bold;">potentiometer</span> is a 
            rheostat with two terminals and a connection in the middle, 
            so the middle terminal can set a precise, variable dividing 
            point between the ends; therefore, a potentiometer can be used 
            as a voltage divider. Rheostats and potentiometers are often 
            operated by knobs or sliders.
        </p>
		<p class="justify">
            A <span style="font-weight: bold;">Wheatstone bridge</span> is 
            a diamond-shaped arrangement of two resistors of known 
            resistance, one rheostat, and a resistor of unknown resistance. 
            With a DC voltage source between the two known resistors, and 
            also between the rheostat and the unknown resistor, this setup 
            can be used to find the resistance of the unknown resistor: an 
            <span style="font-weight: bold;">ammeter</span> (device to 
            measure current) is connected across the two other nodes and the 
            rheostat is adjusted until no current flows.
        </p>
		<p class="justify">
            The formula for solving a Wheatstone bridge uses 
            <span style="font-weight: bold;">Kirchhoff&#8217;s laws</span>: 
            the total current flowing into any point in a circuit equals the 
            total current flowing out of the point, and the total voltage 
            change around any loop of a circuit is 0&nbsp;V.

            <span style="font-family: Cambria; font-weight: bold; 
            font-size: large;">Capacitor</span> A capacitor is a 
            <span style="font-weight: bold;">charge</span>-storing 
            disconnection in a circuit, usually made of 
            <span style="font-weight: bold;">parallel plates</span> separated 
            by a medium that blocks the passage of charge. The inner medium 
            is called a <span style="font-weight: bold;">dielectric</span>. 
            The governing equation of a capacitor is <i>Q</i>&nbsp;=&nbsp;
            <i>C</i>&thinsp;&Delta;<i>V</i>: the charge stored on the 
            capacitor (<i>Q</i>, typically measured in 
            <span style="font-weight: bold;">coulombs</span>) equals the 
            capacitor&#8217;s capacitance (<i>C</i>, typically measured in 
            <span style="font-weight: bold;">farads</span>, or more likely 
            in smaller units like microfarads) times the voltage across the 
            capacitor (&Delta;<i>V</i>).
        </p>
		<p class="justify">
            The total capacitance of a circuit depends on whether capacitors 
            are arranged in parallel or series, but in the opposite fashion 
            as for resistors: If two capacitors having capacitance <i>C</i>
            <sub>1</sub> and <i>C</i><sub>2</sub> are placed in <em>parallel
            </em>, the total capacitance across them is <i>C</i>
            &nbsp;=&nbsp;<i>C</i><sub>1</sub>&nbsp;+&nbsp;<i>C</i>
            <sub>2</sub>; if they are placed in <em>series</em>, then 1/
            <i>C</i>&nbsp;=&nbsp;1/<i>C</i><sub>1</sub>&nbsp;+1/&nbsp;
            <i>C</i><sub>2</sub>. This is because wiring capacitors in 
            parallel effectively expands the area of the parallel plates, so 
            configuring capacitors in parallel increases total capacitance.

            font-size: large;">Inductor</span> A 
            <span style="font-weight: bold;">solenoid</span> is a coil of 
            wire. When electric current through the wire changes, a 
            <span style="font-weight: bold;">magnetic field</span> is 
            generated in the core (interior) of the solenoid. When a 
            solenoid is used in a circuit, it is called an inductor and 
            serves to oppose changes in the current in the circuit. The 
            strength of an inductor is its <span style="font-weight: bold;">
            inductance</span>, symbolized <i>L</i> and measured in 
            <span style="font-weight: bold;">henries</span> (after Joseph 
            Henry, who discovered the principles of 
            <span style="font-weight: bold;">self-inductance</span> and 
            <span style="font-weight: bold;">mutual inductance</span>, 
            though <span style="font-weight: bold;">Michael Faraday</span> 
            published his findings on electromagnetic induction first).
        </p>
		<p class="justify">
            The voltage across an inductor only depends on the change in 
            current, so inductors are particularly used with 
            <span style="font-weight: bold;">alternating current</span>. 
            For standard (sinusoidal) alternating current, an inductor 
            only changes the <em style="font-weight: bold;">phase</em> of 
            the current through it.
        </p>
		<p class="justify">
            Inductors function the same way as resistors when arranged in 
            series or parallel.

            <span style="font-family: Cambria; font-weight: bold; 
            font-size: large;">Transformer</span> A transformer is a pair of 
            solenoids connected to a central <span style="font-weight: bold;">
            core</span>, which permits the circulation of 
            <span style="font-weight: bold;">magnetic flux</span>. Because 
            the flux in the core is constant, an alternating current in one 
            coil produces a changing magnetic field, inducing an 
            alternating current in the second coil. If the coils have 
            different numbers of turns of wire (as is typical), the current 
            in the second coil will have a different voltage than the 
            current in the first coil. Therefore, transformers are used to 
            <span style="font-weight: bold;">&#8220;step up&#8221;</span> 
            or <span style="font-weight: bold;">&#8220;step down&#8221;
            </span> voltage, for example in power transmission lines and in 
            adapters for household electronics.

		<p class="justify">
            <span style="font-family: Cambria; font-weight: bold; 
            font-size: large;">Source</span> A source is any device that 
            provides voltage or current. <span style="font-weight: bold;">
            Direct current</span> (DC) sources like batteries provide constant 
            current, while <span style="font-weight: bold;">alternating current
            </span> (AC) sources like household electric outlets provide 
            current that changes at a regular frequency with a constant average 
            voltage.
        </p>
		<p class="justify">
            In alternating-current circuits, capacitors and inductors can help 
            tune a circuit&#8217;s efficiency by contributing to a phenomenon 
            called <span style="font-weight: bold;">impedance</span>, which is 
            the complex analogue of resistance. A circuit&#8217;s 
            <span style="font-weight: bold;">reactance</span> is the imaginary 
            part of its impedance and depends on the frequency of the circuit. 
            When reactance is balanced, we find the frequency at which the 
            circuit loses the least energy, or its 
            <span style="font-weight: bold;">resonant frequency</span>.

            font-size: large;">Ground</span> A ground or earth is a point on a 
            circuit that is connected to the ground. This is to prevent 
            accidental discharge of electricity from an unexpected 
            connection&mdash;a person who touches an ungrounded circuit might 
            cause electricity to pass through their body. This lets ground act 
            as a known reference point of voltage for analyzing circuits: any 
            grounded point in the circuit is typically understood to have 
            zero voltage.

            font-size: large;">Fuses and circuit breakers</span> When excess 
            current flows through a fuse, the fuse deforms or disconnects so 
            that no current can flow in the circuit. This protects the 
            equipment in the circuit from being damaged by 
            <span style="font-weight: bold;">power surges</span> and also 
            protects the surroundings (as excess current can cause wires to 
            overheat, starting a fire). Fuses typically melt and thus must be 
            completely replaced after tripping; a circuit breaker is a form 
            of fuse that can be reset and restored after the circuit has 
            been verified to be safe.

            different closed connections.

            font-size: large;">Diode</span> A diode permits the flow of 
            current in only one direction. Ideally, a diode permits any 
            amount of current in one direction but has a very high 
            resistance to current in the opposite direction. In practice, 
            there is a minimum voltage that must be provided before current 
            will flow, called the <span style="font-weight: bold;">bias 
            voltage</span>, and there is a voltage past which the resistance 
            of the diode reduces and current flows backward, called the 
            <span style="font-weight: bold;">breakdown voltage</span>.

		<p class="justify">
            In a <span style="font-weight: bold;">Zener diode</span>, the 
            breakdown voltage is well-defined with as sharp a transition 
            as possible, so engineers can design a circuit around the 
            breakdown voltage characteristic.

            is a diode that lights up when current passes through in the

            font-size: large;">Rectifier</span> A rectifier is a device 
            that converts AC or another variable signal into a positive-
            voltage signal. A <span style="font-weight: bold;">half-wave 
            rectifier</span> simply zeroes out negative voltage, while a 
            <span style="font-weight: bold;">full-wave rectifier</span> 
            essentially acts as an absolute value function, converting 
            negative voltage to positive voltage. A rectifier can be 
            combined with a capacitor to approximately convert AC into DC.

            <span style="font-family: Cambria; font-weight: bold; 
            font-size: large;">Op-amp</span> An op-amp (operational 
            amplifier) is a five-port device that changes a voltage 
            difference across two ports, multiplied by a factor 
            (<span style="font-weight: bold;">gain</span>), into a voltage 
            on an output port, using power supplied to two power ports. There 
            are various ways to wire an op-amp, often feeding an output back 
            into an input, to accomplish interesting tasks like subtracting 
            and multiplying voltages.
        </p>
		<p class="justify">
            An ideal op-amp is assumed to have infinite gain, so when solving 
            a circuit, the two inputs must reach a point with no voltage 
            difference across them. Real op-amps have finite gain, impedance 
            across their inputs, resistance on their output, and a finite 
            bandwidth or spread of operating frequencies when used with 
            alternating current.
