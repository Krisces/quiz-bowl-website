        <span class="label">Thomas Young&#8217;s double-slit experiment</span> 
        (circa 1800), which predated the development of quantum mechanics by 
        over a century, demonstrated that light can behave as either a wave 
        or a particle. After passing a beam of light through two narrowly 
        spaced slits, Young observed the characteristic light and dark 
        fringes of <span style="font-weight: bold;">interference</span> seen 
        when light acts as a wave. More modern versions that add detectors 
        showing which slit the light passes through, however, show that the 
        light passes through one slit or the other, acting as photons; 
        moreover, the interference pattern disappears. A modern variant, 
        called a <span style="font-weight: bold;">quantum eraser</span>, 
        demonstrates <span style="font-weight: bold;">quantum entanglement
        </span> (the ability to exchange information over large distances 
        instantaneously).

        The <span class="label">Michelson-Morley experiment</span> (1887), 
        conducted by Albert Michelson and Edward Morley at what is now Case 
        Western Reserve University, disproved the existence of the 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">luminiferous aether</span>, a 
        hypothetical medium through which light waves supposedly moved. 
        (The aether is sometimes called simply &#8220;ether,&#8221; but is 
        not to be confused with ethers from organic chemistry.) The 
        experiment used an <span style="font-weight: bold;">interferometer
        </span>, a device that splits a beam of light and aims it using 
        mirrors to allow the beam to interfere with itself; the 
        interferometer was mounted on a slab of marble floating in a pool 
        of mercury so that it could turn without friction, to eliminate the 
        possibility that the interferometer was misoriented. While 
        Michelson and Morley expected to find a shift in the interference 
        pattern&#8217;s fringes as a result of the ether, the experiment 
        showed that the Earth had no motion relative to the ether, 
        suggesting that the ether did not exist. Often called the most 
        famous failed experiment in science, the Michelson-Morley experiment 
        is a fundamental test of special relativity.

        The <span class="label">Millikan oil-drop experiment</span> (1909), 
        performed by Robert A. Millikan and Harvey Fletcher to measure the 
        charge of the electron. In the first step, the terminal velocity of 
        an oil drop was measured, which means that the drag force (which 
        can be calculated using Stokes&#8217; law) equals the force of 
        gravity. From this, the mass can be calculated. Then, by turning on 
        an electric field, the particle starts to move <em>upward</em> with 
        a terminal velocity when the electric force balances out the forces 
        of gravity and drag. Using this, and the mass of the drop, the total 
        charge on the drop can be calculated. Millikan and Fletcher found 
        that the total charge on the drops were always 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">quantized</span>&mdash;that is, 
        always an integer multiple of some constant; specifically, the 
        constant they found is about 1.59 &times; 10<sup>&ndash;19</sup>
        &nbsp;coulombs, within 1% of the currently accepted value.

        The <span class="label">Rutherford gold foil experiment</span> 
        (1908&ndash;1913), sometimes named after Rutherford&#8217;s 
        assistants Hans Geiger and Ernest Marsden, discovered the 
        positively-charged nucleus of the atom; as a result, it disproved 
        J.&nbsp;J. Thomson&#8217;s <span style="font-weight: bold;">plum 
        pudding model</span>. The experimenters fired 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">alpha particles</span> (helium 
        nuclei) at a sheet of gold foil. (They also used other elements, 
        including silver.) The scattered particles were detected by a 
        screen containing <span style="font-weight: bold;">zinc sulfide
        </span>, which fluoresced when the alpha particles hit it. While 
        most of the alpha particles went straight through the foil with 
        minimal scattering, a small fraction of alpha particles were 
        reflected back at the source. This result was unexpected, as 
        backscattering could only occur if the alpha particles were 
        colliding with a particle massive enough to reverse their momentum. 
        Rutherford said &#8220;It was almost as incredible as if you fired 
        a 15-inch shell at a piece of tissue paper and it came back and 
        hit you.&#8221;

        The <span class="label">Stern-Gerlach experiment</span> (1922), 
        conducted by Otto Stern and Walther Gerlach, demonstrated that the 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">angular momentum</span> of an atom 
        is <span style="font-weight: bold;">quantized</span>. A beam of 
        silver atoms was fired through an inhomogeneous magnetic field 
        (one that varies through space). Instead of hitting a screen in 
        a continuous distribution, they hit at discrete points, 
        demonstrating the quantized nature of angular momentum. This 
        experiment was actually performed several years before the concept 
        of electron <span style="font-weight: bold;">spin</span> was even 
        proposed. A variant on this experiment was used to create an energy 
        source for the first hydrogen maser.

        The <span class="label">Davisson-Germer experiment</span> 
        (1923&ndash;1927), performed by Clinton Davisson and Lester Germer, 
        confirmed the <span style="font-weight: bold;">de&nbsp;Broglie 
        hypothesis</span> by showing that electrons can exhibit wave-like 
        behavior. The experimenters fired electrons at a nickel crystal, 
        and measured the <span style="font-weight: bold;">diffraction 
        patterns</span> using an electron counter called a 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Faraday box</span> (or Faraday cup) 
        mounted on an arc so that it could detect electrons emitted at 
        various angles. The peak intensity was observed at 50 degrees and 
        54 electronvolts, corresponding to the diffraction predicted for 
        X-rays by <span style="font-weight: bold;">Bragg&#8217;s law</span>. 
        (Note that diffraction is a property of waves, not particles, and 
        thus could only be observed if electrons can act as waves.)

        <span class="label">Gregor Mendel&#8217;s experiments with pea plants
        </span> (1860s) pioneered the study of genetics. Mendel, an Austrian 
        monk, proposed the <span style="font-weight: bold;">law of 
        segregation</span>, which holds that each organism has two 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">alleles</span> for each trait, 
        which are segregated into <span style="font-weight: bold;">gametes
        </span> so that each gamete inherits one copy, as well as the 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">law of independent assortment
        </span>, which says that genes for individual traits are inherited 
        independently. He supported both of those laws with experimental 
        evidence by growing and counting pea plants. He worked with seven 
        characteristics including plant height, seed shape, and color. 
        His experiments primarily consisted of 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">hybridizing</span> plants with 
        certain characteristics, and observing what fraction of the next 
        generation had certain traits. His results were remarkably close 
        to the values that would be predicted from modern 
        genetics&mdash;close enough, in fact, that Mendel has been accused 
        of manipulating his data.

	<li class="list_item">
        The <span class="label">Hershey-Chase experiment</span> (1952), by 
        Alfred Hershey and Martha Chase, demonstrated that the material 
        responsible for inheritance of traits was DNA rather than protein. 
        The experiment was carried out by creating radiolabeled 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">T2 bacteriophages</span> (viruses 
        that infect bacteria). In one population, the phages&#8217; DNA 
        contained phosphorus-32 in its backbone; in the other population, 
        the phages&#8217; proteins contained sulfur-35. The phages were 
        then allowed to infect <i>E. coli</i>. After using a centrifuge to 
        remove the viral coats from the bacteria, Hershey and Chase found 
        that the viruses labeled with sulfur did <em>not</em> transfer their 
        radioactivity to the cells, while the viruses labeled with phosphorus 
        did. This result, combined with other experiments, demonstrated that 
        the genetic material was DNA, not protein.

        The <span class="label">Miller-Urey experiment</span> (1952) was an 
        attempt to demonstrate a possible mechanism&mdash;proposed by John 
        Haldane and Alexander Oparin&mdash;for how life could form from 
        inorganic chemicals. Stanley Miller and Harold Urey modeled 
        Earth&#8217;s prebiotic atmosphere as a mixture of water, methane 
        (CH<sub>4</sub>), ammonia (NH<sub>3</sub>), and hydrogen. They 
        allowed those four substances to react in an apparatus over a one-
        week period; the apparatus included a heater to convert the water 
        to water vapor and an electrode to simulate lightning strikes. The 
        resulting mixture contained more than 20 distinct 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">amino acids</span> that formed 
        spontaneously; a more modern &quot;volcanic&quot; version of the 
        experiment produced even more amino acids by including sulfur 
        compounds.

	<li class="list_item">
        The <span class="label">Meselson-Stahl experiment</span> (1958) proved 
        that DNA replication is <span style="font-weight: bold;">
        semiconservative</span>, meaning that when a double-helix strand of 
        DNA is duplicated, the result is two double-helix strands, each of 
        which has one helix from the parent molecule and one newly-
        synthesized helix. Matthew Meselson and Franklin Stahl used <i>E. 
        coli</i> grown in a medium containing only nitrogen-15; they were 
        then allowed to synthesize DNA in an environment containing only 
        nitrogen-14 over two generations. The net result was that in the 
        second generation, half the DNA molecules contained nitrogen-15 in 
        one strand and nitrogen-14 in the other, while the other half of 
        the molecules contained only nitrogen-14.
