    The following list of nine American warships includes eight of the most important or interesting ships in the U.S. Navy, 
    as well as one from the navy of the Confederate States of America.  Though there are some ships that were more involved 
    in battle, these mark significant advancements in naval technology or turning points in U.S. history; most importantly, 
    they are the ships that come up most frequently in quiz bowl.

        USS&nbsp;<i>Constitution</i></span> Better known as 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">
        &#8220;Old Ironsides,&#8221;</span> the 
        <i>Constitution</i> was one of the 
        first six ships commissioned by the 
        U.S. Navy after the American Revolution. Launched from Boston in 1797, 
        the <i>Constitution</i> first saw action as the squadron 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">flagship</span> in the 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Quasi-War</span> with France from 
        1799&ndash;1801 and also fought in the 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">
        Barbary War</span> and the 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">War of 1812
        </span>. She later served many years 
        as the nation&#8217;s flagship in 
        the Mediterranean. Retired from active duty in 1846, the words of 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Oliver Wendell Holmes</span>&#8217; 
        poem <a style="font-weight: bold; color: maroon;" target="_blank" 
        href="http://www.ibiblio.org/eldritch/owh/oldiron.html">&#8220;Old 
        Ironsides&#8221;</a> saved her from 
        the scrap yard&mdash;she became the 
        training ship of the U.S. Naval Academy 
        until the mid-1880s. She became 
        the symbolic flagship of the U.S. Navy in 1940 and is now a floating 
        museum in Boston.

        USS&nbsp;<i>Chesapeake</i></span> The USS&nbsp;<i>Chesapeake</i> was 
        built at what is now the 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Norfolk Naval 
        Shipyard</span>, between 1798 and 1799. The <i>Chesapeake</i> was 
        attacked by the British <i style="font-weight: bold;">Leopard</i> off 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">
        Cape Henry</span> in 1807 (which led to 
        the duel between <span style="font-weight: bold;">Commodores James 
        Barron</span> and <span style="font-weight: bold;">Stephen Decatur
        </span>), one of the causes of the 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">War 
        of 1812</span>. She was captured off Boston in 1813 by the British 
        frigate <i style="font-weight: bold;">
        Shannon</i>, on which occasion her 
        commander, Captain James Lawrence, uttered his celebrated dying words, 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">&#8220;Don&#8217;t give up the 
        ship,&#8221;</span> which have become a tradition in the U.S. Navy.

        USS&nbsp;<i>Lawrence</i>/USS&nbsp;<i>Niagara</i></span> 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Oliver Hazard Perry</span>&#8217;s 
        decisive victory over the British fleet in the 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Battle of Lake Erie</span> on 
        September&nbsp;10, 1813 ensured American control of the Great Lakes 
        during the <span style="font-weight: bold;">War of 1812</span>. In the 
        battle, Perry&#8217;s flagship, the USS&nbsp;<i>Lawrence</i>, was 
        severely damaged and four-fifths of her crew killed or wounded. 
        Commodore Perry and a small contingent rowed a half-mile through heavy 
        gunfire to another American ship, the <span style="font-weight: bold;">
        USS&nbsp;<i>Niagara</i></span>. Boarding and taking command, he brought 
        her into battle and soundly defeated 
        the British fleet. Perry summarized 
        the fight in a now-famous message to <span style="font-weight: bold;">
        General William Henry Harrison</span>: 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">
        &#8220;We have met the enemy and they are ours.&#8221;</span>

        USS&nbsp;<i>Monitor</i></span>/
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">CSS <i>

        <span style="font-family: Cambria; 
        font-weight: bold; font-size: large;">
        USS&nbsp;<i>Merrimack</i></span> 
        After departing Union forces burned the 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">
        Gosport Navy Yard</span> in Norfolk in 
        April 1861, yard workers salvaged 
        the USS&nbsp;<i>Merrimack</i> and converted her into the 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">ironclad
        </span> CSS <i>Virginia</i>. On 
        March 8, 1862, the CSS&nbsp;<i>Virginia</i> left the shipyard and sank 
        two Union warships in <span style="font-weight: bold;">Hampton Roads
        </span>. The South&#8217;s ironclad rammed and sank the 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">USS&nbsp;<i>Cumberland</i></span> and 
        set fire to and sank the <span style="font-weight: bold;">USS&nbsp;<i>
        Congress</i></span>.  The <i>Monitor</i> was sent to end its rampage 
        and the two ironclads battled for 3&frac12;&nbsp;hours before the <i>
        Virginia</i> ran aground in its attempt to ram the 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">USS&nbsp;<i>Minnesota</i></span>. 
        Visibly damaged, the <i>Virginia</i> retreated and the <i>Monitor</i> 
        withdrew to protect the <i>Minnesota</i>. 
        The Confederates destroyed the 
        <i>Virginia</i> soon after to prevent her capture by Union forces. The 
        <i>Monitor</i>, victorious in her first battle, sank in a storm off 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Cape Hatteras, North Carolina</span>. 
        The shipwreck is a national underwater sanctuary under the purview of 
        the NOAA.

        USS&nbsp;<i>Maine</i></span> (ACR&ndash;1) [Second class] The first <i>
        Maine</i>, a second-class armored battleship, was launched in 1889 and 
        in 1897 sailed for <span style="font-weight: bold;">Havana</span> to 
        show the flag and protect American citizens. 
        Shortly after 9:40&nbsp;pm 
        on February&nbsp;15, 1898, the battleship was 
        torn apart by a tremendous 
        explosion. The court of inquiry convened in March was unable to obtain 
        evidence associating the blast with any person or persons, but public 
        opinion&mdash;inflamed by 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">&#8220;yellow 
        journalism&#8221;</span>&mdash;was such that the <i>Maine</i> disaster 
        led to the <span style="font-weight: bold;">declaration of 
        war on Spain</span> on April&nbsp;21, 1898.

        USS&nbsp;<i>Arizona</i></span> 
        (BB&ndash;39) [<i>Pennsylvania</i> class] 
        A lead ship of the honor escort for <span style="font-weight: bold;">
        President Wilson</span>&#8217;s trip to France in 1918, she was on 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Battleship Row</span> at 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Pearl Harbor</span> when Japanese 
        aircraft appeared just before 
        8:00&nbsp;am on Sunday, December&nbsp;7, 
        1941. The <i>Arizona</i> came under attack almost immediately, and at 
        about 8:10 was hit by an 800-kilogram bomb just forward of turret two 
        on the starboard side. Within a few seconds the forward powder 
        magazines exploded, killing 1,177 of 
        the crew, and the ship sank to the 
        bottom of the harbor. In 1962 the USS&nbsp;<i>Arizona</i> memorial 
        opened and is now administered by the National Park Service.

        USS&nbsp;<i>Missouri</i></span> (BB&ndash;63) [<i>Iowa</i> class] The 
        fourth USS&nbsp;<i>Missouri</i> was 
        the last battleship completed by the 
        United States; she was laid down January&nbsp;6, 1941 by 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">
        New York Naval Shipyard</span>. The <i>
        Missouri</i> was launched on January&nbsp;29, 1944 and received her 
        sponsorship from <span style="font-weight: bold;">Miss Margaret Truman
        </span>, daughter of the then-Missouri Senator, 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">
        Harry S. Truman</span>. Commissioned on 
        June&nbsp;11, 1944, the &#8220;Mighty Mo,&#8221; as she became known, 
        sailed for the Pacific and quickly became the flagship of 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">
        Admiral Halsey</span>, which is why she 
        was chosen as the <span style="font-weight: bold;">site of the formal

        September&nbsp;1, 1945.

        In 1951 Congress authorized construction of the world&#8217;s first 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">nuclear-powered submarine</span>. On 
        December&nbsp;12 of that year, the Navy Department announced that she 
        would be the sixth ship of the fleet to bear the name <i>Nautilus</i>. 
        She was launched on January&nbsp;21, 1954. Eight months later, on 
        September&nbsp;30, 1954, the <i>Nautilus</i> became the first 
        commissioned nuclear-powered ship in the U.S. Navy. On the morning of 
        January&nbsp;17, 1955, <i>Nautilus</i>&#8217; 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Commander Wilkinson</span> signaled
