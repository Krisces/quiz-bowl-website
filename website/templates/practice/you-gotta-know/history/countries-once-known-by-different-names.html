        <span class="label">Bangladesh</span> adopted its current name upon 
        gaining its <span style="font-weight: bold;">independence from 
        Pakistan in 1971</span>. In 1947, the <span style="font-weight: bold;">
        partition of British India</span> created the new countries of India 
        and Pakistan, based on the majority religion of various areas. The new 
        Dominion of Pakistan consisted of the areas where 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Islam</span> was the majority 
        religion, and was split into two separate exclaves: 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">West Pakistan</span>, consisting of 
        what is now Pakistan; and <span style="font-weight: bold;">East 
        Pakistan</span>, covering what is now Bangladesh and consisting mostly 
        of ethnic <span style="font-weight: bold;">Bengali</span> people. In 
        1966 <span style="font-weight: bold;">Sheikh Mujibur Rahman</span>, 
        then head of East Pakistan&#8217;s <span style="font-weight: bold;">
        Awami League</span>, launched a major push for greater autonomy. In 
        1971 Pakistan began a <span style="font-weight: bold;">genocide</span> 
        within East Pakistan in response to independence calls; one day later, 
        East Pakistan officially declared independence as 
        &#8220;Bangladesh.&#8221; In the subsequent 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Liberation War</span>, the Bengalis 
        were supported by India. Pakistani forces surrendered in December 1971.

    <li class="list_item">
        <span class="label">Bangladesh</span> adopted its current name upon 
        gaining its <span style="font-weight: bold;">independence from 
        Burkina Faso</span> assumed its current name in 1984, having 
        previously been known as the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Republic 
        of Upper Volta</span>. France controlled the region under the name 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">French Upper Volta</span>&mdash;which 
        referred to its position along the upper course of the 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Volta River</span>&mdash;for much of 
        the 20th century, during which it was one part of French West Africa. 
        Under the 1956 <span style="font-weight: bold;">Basic Law</span>, it 
        was made a self-governing colony of France; two years later, it became 
        fully independent under President <span style="font-weight: bold;">
        Maurice Yam&eacute;ogo</span>, who was overthrown in 1966. A 1983 
        coup d&#8217;&eacute;tat brought military officer 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Thomas Sankara</span> to power; 
        the year after his ascent, he changed the country&#8217;s name to 
        &#8220;Burkina Faso,&#8221; which roughly translates as 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">&#8220;land of the upright&#8221;
        </span> in two native tongues. Sankara was assassinated in 1987.

    <li class="list_item">
        <span class="label">The Democratic Republic of the Congo</span> was 
        known as <span style="font-weight: bold;">Zaire</span> between 1971 
        and 1997. The 1971 name change came about under the rule of 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Mobutu Sese Seko</span>, a dictator 
        who effectively seized power during the 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Congo Crisis</span> of 
        1960&ndash;1965, during which he toppled and later executed Prime 
        Minister Patrice Lumumba. The name &#8220;Zaire&#8221; was derived 
        from the Portuguese word for the <span style="font-weight: bold;">
        Congo River</span>, which itself was derived from a Bantu-language 
        name for the river. Mobutu was ousted and forced into exile 
        following the 1997 <span style="font-weight: bold;">First Congo War
        </span> by the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Alliance of 
        Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo</span>, a coalition 
        led by <span style="font-weight: bold;">Laurent Kabila</span>. 
        Four days after seizing power, Kabila changed the country&#8217;s 
        name back to the DRC.

    <li class="list_item">
        <span class="label">eSwatini</span> (also commonly stylized as class="label"family: Cambria; font-weight: bold; 
        font-size: large;">Eswatini</span>) adopted its current name in 2018, 
        following a proclamation to that effect by 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">King Mswati&nbsp;III</span>, who uses 
        the title <i style="font-weight: bold;">Ingwenyama</i>. The tiny 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">absolute monarchy</span>, which is 
        sandwiched between South Africa and Mozambique, had previously been 
        known as <span style="font-weight: bold;">Swaziland</span> since it 
        became a British protectorate in 1906 following the Second Boer War. 
        The country, which is mostly populated by ethnic Swazis, gained 
        independence from Britain in 1968. The new name of eSwatini, which 
        was adopted in part to mark 50 years of independence, means 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">&#8220;the land of Swazis&#8221;
        </span> in the country&#8217;s native tongue, which is also known 
        as Swazi.

    <li class="list_item">
        <span class="label">Ghana</span> is a nation of former British holdings 
        on Africa&#8217;s west coast, the most prominent of which was the 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Gold Coast</span>. The Gold Coast 
        was so named by multiple European powers for the rich 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">gold reserves</span> found within 
        the area; in time, the region also became heavily involved in the 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">slave trade</span>. Britain 
        incorporated its <span style="font-weight: bold;">Gold Coast Colony
        </span> in 1821 after seizing the chartered lands of the 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">African Company of Merchants</span>, 
        which had continued to trade in slaves after Britain had outlawed 
        the trade in 1807; Britain subsequently subsumed other 
        nations&#8217;s holdings in the region into the British Gold Coast. 
        The modern push for independence began in the late 1940s, and was led 
        by <span style="font-weight: bold;">Kwame Nkrumah</span>, who later 
        served as Ghana&#8217;s first prime minister and first president. 
        Britain combined its Gold Coast, <span style="font-weight: bold;">
        Northern Territories</span>, <span style="font-weight: bold;">
        Ashanti</span>, and <span style="font-weight: bold;">Togoland</span> 
        colonies into a single entity, which became the Dominion of Ghana in 
        1957. Ghana became a fully independent republic in 1960.

    <li class="list_item">
        <span class="label">North Macedonia</span> officially became known as 
        such in February 2019. For over two decades, the country&#8217;s 
        former name, <span style="font-weight: bold;">Macedonia</span> had 
        been the subject of a dispute with <span style="font-weight: bold;">
        Greece</span>, which objected to the use of the name 
        &#8220;Macedonia&#8221; due both to the name&#8217;s ties to the 
        ancient <span style="font-weight: bold;">Kingdom of Macedon</span>, 
        and the fact that Greece itself contains an administrative region 
        named &#8220;Macedonia.&#8221; For many years, the country was 
        referred to in the United Nations as the 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia 
        (FYROM)</span> due to the Greek objection, which also prevented 
        Macedonia from joining the EU and NATO. The countries agreed to 
        resolve the naming dispute in the 2018 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Treaty of Prespa</span>.
    </li>
    <li class="list_item">
        <span class="label">Sri Lanka</span> was referred to by numerous 
        different names in various ancient Greek, Sanskrit, and Arabic texts, 
        including <span style="font-weight: bold;">Taprobana</span> and 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Serendib</span>, and the island 
        became widely known as <span style="font-weight: bold;">Ceylon
        </span> following Portuguese arrival in 1505. The Portuguese gave 
        the island the name <span style="font-weight: bold;">Ceil&atilde;o
        </span>, which was translated into English as &#8220;Ceylon.&#8221; 
        The Portuguese, who clashed with the island&#8217;s 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Kingdom of Kandy</span>, were 
        largely driven off the island by a coalition of the Dutch and the 
        island&#8217;s <span style="font-weight: bold;">Sinhalese</span> 
        people beginning in the 1640s. In 1796, the island passed into 
        British hands after the Dutch were conquered by Napoleon. As part 
        of the divestment of British colonies following World War II, the 
        Dominion of Ceylon became an independent 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Commonwealth of Nations</span> 
        state in 1948. It adopted the name &#8220;Sri Lanka&#8221; in 1972.
    </li>
    <li class="list_item">
        <span class="label">The Kingdom of Thailand</span> had its name 
        changed from <span style="font-weight: bold;">&#8220;Siam&#8221;
        </span> twice within a decade. Portuguese explorers began using the 
        term &#8220;Siam&#8221; to refer to the region in the 1500s; such 
        usage gained official prominence via its use by rulers from the 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Chakri dynasty</span>. A rebellion 
        and monarchical crisis in the 1930s led to the 1938 rise of 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Luang Phibunsongkhram</span>, 
        commonly known as <span style="font-weight: bold;">Phibun</span>. 
        In 1939 Phibun officially changed the country&#8217;s name to 
        Thailand, or <span style="font-weight: bold;">Prathet Thai</span>, 
        having a double meaning of &#8220;Land of the Thai&#8221; and 
        &#8220;Land of the Free&#8221;&mdash;part of Phibun&#8217;s campaign 
        against China. Phibun allied with the Japanese during World 
        War&nbsp;II but was forced out of power in 1944. In 1945, the 
        country&#8217;s post-war government changed the nation&#8217;s name 
        back to Siam; however, another monarchical crisis sparked by the 
        1946 assassination of <span style="font-weight: bold;">
        Rama&nbsp;VIII</span> led to Phidun&#8217;s return to power in 1948 
        with U.S. support. In 1949 he once again renamed the country 
        &#8220;Thailand.&#8221;
    </li>
    <li class="list_item">
        <span class="label">The United Arab Emirates</span> is a federation 
        of seven internal states (Abu Dhabi, Dubai, Ajman,  Fujairah, Sharjah, 
        Umm Al Quwain, and Ras Al Khaimah) that were previously known as the 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Trucial States</span> and which 
        united in 1971. The Trucial States were a group of seven 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">sheikhdoms</span> that 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">signed treaties</span> (or truces) 
        with Great Britain beginning in 1820. These states lay along what 
        Britain termed the <span style="font-weight: bold;">&#8220;Pirate 
        Coast&#8221;</span> of the Persian Gulf; the treaties were intended 
        to protect British ships from raids. In the late 19th century, these 
        treaties evolved into an <span style="font-weight: bold;">Exclusive 
        Agreement</span>, in which Britain promised the emirates military 
        protection. In 1968, Britain announced it would withdraw military 
        support from the region. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Zayed 
        bin Sultan Al&nbsp;Nahyan</span>, the emir of 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Abu Dhabi</span>, negotiated an 
        agreement among the Trucial States to join together and became the 
        first president of the United Arab Emirates when it was established 
        in December 1971.
    </li>
    <li class="list_item">
        <span class="label">Zimbabwe</span> assumed its current name upon 
        its formal independence from Britain in 1980 and was named after 
        the ruined city of <span style="font-weight: bold;">Great Zimbabwe
        </span> within its borders. Zimbabwe grew out of the colony of 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Rhodesia</span>, named for 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Cecil Rhodes</span>, which Britain 
        established in southern Africa in the late 19th century. That colony 
        was later split along the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Zambezi 
        River</span> into <span style="font-weight: bold;">Northern Rhodesia
        </span> (which later became the country of 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Zambia</span>) and 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Southern Rhodesia</span>. Southern 
        Rhodesia&#8217;s white government attempted to declare independence 
        from Britain in 1965 (as simply &#8220;Rhodesia&#8221;) in an effort 
        to suppress the country&#8217;s black population, leading to the 
        15-year-long <span style="font-weight: bold;">Rhodesian Bush War
        </span>. Under the 1979 <span style="font-weight: bold;">Lancaster 
        House Agreement</span>, Britain resumed control long enough to 
        oversee elections that were won by the 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">ZANU party</span>, led by 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Robert Mugabe</span>, who ruled 
        the new country for the next 37 years.
