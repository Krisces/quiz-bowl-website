    <li class="list_item">
        <span class="label">Harper&#8217;s Weekly</span> (1857&ndash;1916) was 
        the most popular American magazine during the Civil War. In 1863 it 
        published an article about a slave named 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Gordon</span> along with a widely 
        circulated photograph of his whipped, mutilated back that roused 
        abolitionist sentiment across the North. 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">George William Curtis</span>, a 
        co-founder of the Republican Party, was its political editor from 
        1863 to 1892, during which time he ran cartoons by 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Thomas Nast</span>, including 
        Nast&#8217;s portrayals of Boss Tweed and the Tammany Hall political 
        machine. (Although Nast&#8217;s <i>Harper&#8217;s Weekly</i> work 
        did popularize American symbols like Uncle Sam, Columbia, and the 
        Democratic donkey, Nast was not the inventor of those symbols.)
    </li>
    <li class="list_item">
        <span class="label">The Atlantic</span> (1857&ndash;present) was 
        founded in Boston as an <span style="font-weight: bold;">abolitionist
        </span> periodical by Harriet Beecher Stowe, Ralph Waldo Emerson, 
        Oliver Wendell Holmes Sr., and many others. In 1862 it published 
        Julia Ward Howe&#8217;s <span style="font-weight: bold;">&#8220;The 
        Battle Hymn of the Republic,&#8221;</span> and in 1963 it published 
        Martin Luther King Jr.&#8217;s <span style="font-weight: bold;">
        &#8220;Letter from Birmingham Jail&#8221;</span> for a nationwide 
        audience. More recently, it ran Ta-Nehisi Coates&#8217;s 2014 article 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">&#8220;The Case for Reparations,
        &#8221;</span> which advocates reimbursing the descendants of 
        American slaves. Despite its political emphasis, it has only ever 
        endorsed three presidential candidates: Abraham Lincoln in 1864, 
        Lyndon Johnson in 1964, and Hillary Clinton in 2016.
    </li>
    <li class="list_item">
        <span class="label">Puck</span> (1871&ndash;1915) was a humor and 
        satire magazine best remembered for its vivid political cartoons. 
        Founded by Austrian-born Joseph Keppler, it often glorified 
        American imperialism and had an anti-Catholic lens. Iconic cartoons 
        over its 45-year run include <span style="font-weight: bold;">Jay 
        Gould</span> using Wall Street as a &#8220;personal bowling 
        alley,&#8221; <span style="font-weight: bold;">robber barons</span> 
        slicing up America with carving knives, John D. Rockefeller as a 
        king with an huge <span style="font-weight: bold;">crown of railroads
        </span>, <span style="font-weight: bold;">Uncle Sam as a schoolteacher
        </span> looming over racist caricatures of its new territories, and 
        Columbia admiring her <span style="font-weight: bold;">bonnet of 
        gunboats</span> in a mirror. (<i>Puck</i> should not be confused 
        with <i>Punch</i>, a British magazine of the same era also noted 
        for its political cartoons.)
    </li>
    <li class="list_item">
        <span class="label">McClure&#8217;s Magazine</span> (1893&ndash;1929) 
        was founded explicitly to publish the investigative journalism now 
        known as <span style="font-weight: bold;">&#8220;muckraking.&#8221;
        </span> In 1901 its staff writer Ray Stannard Baker published 
        <i style="font-weight: bold;">What the U.S. Steel Corporation Really 
        Is, and How It Works</i>. In 1902 it ran Ida Tarbell&#8217;s 
        <i style="font-weight: bold;">The History of the Standard Oil 
        Company</i>. Lincoln Steffens&#8217;s series on political machines, 
        <i>Tweed Days in St. Louis</i>, was later compiled as the 1906 book 
        <i style="font-weight: bold;">The Shame of the Cities</i>. Willa 
        Cather helped write its highly skeptical 1909 biography 
        <i style="font-weight: bold;">The Life of Mary Baker G. Eddy and the 
        History of Christian Science</i>.
    </li>
    <li class="list_item">
        <span class="label">Cosmopolitan</span> (1886&ndash;present) began as 
        a classy, largely inoffensive magazine until 1965, when 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Helen Gurley Brown</span> became 
        its editor and made it a women&#8217;s magazine geared towards 
        fashion and romantic relationships. (Three years prior, Brown rose to 
        fame for her popular, controversial non-fiction book 
        <i style="font-weight: bold;">Sex and the Single Girl</i>.) <i>
        Cosmopolitan</i>&#8217;s new angle was viewed as misogynistic by most 
        leading feminists; copies were burned alongside <i>Playboy</i> at 
        protests against the <span style="font-weight: bold;">1968 Miss 
        America pageant</span>. In 1989 it ran an article falsely stating 
        heterosexual women cannot contract HIV, prompting protests from ACT 
        UP and other gay organizations.
    </li>
    <li class="list_item">
        <span class="label">Time</span> (1923&ndash;present) was the 
        U.S.&#8217;s first weekly newsmagazine. Its founder, 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Henry Luce</span>, used its 
        near-instant success to create a stable of influential magazines, 
        including <i>Life</i>, <i>Fortune</i>, and <i>Sports Illustrated</i>. 
        Since 1927 it has designated various figures as 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">&#8220;Person of the Year&#8221;
        </span> (originally &#8220;Man of the Year&#8221;), the first being 
        Charles Lindbergh; controversial picks for the award include Adolf 
        Hitler in 1938 and Joseph Stalin in both 1939 and 1942. In June 1994, 
        <i>Time</i> was criticized for darkening the 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">mugshot of O.&nbsp;J. Simpson</span> 
        on its cover, especially juxtaposed against <i>Newsweek</i>&#8217;s 
        largely undoctored version on their cover the same month. After 9/11, 
        <i>Time</i>&#8217;s cover showed the second plane flying into the Twin 
        Towers and used a black border in place of its iconic 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">red border</span>.
    </li>
    <li class="list_item">
        <span class="label">National Review</span> (1955&ndash;present) was 
        founded by the foremost leader of the American conservative movement 
        in the 20th century, <span style="font-weight: bold;">William F. 
        Buckley Jr.</span>, and aimed from its outset to define and promote 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">right-wing thought</span>. Its 
        earliest editors were staunch anti-Communists like 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Whittaker Chambers</span>. Under 
        Buckley, <i>National Review</i> expanded conservatism&#8217;s allies 
        to include libertarians while disavowing anti-Semitic and nativist 
        elements, such as the John Birch Society. After Barry 
        Goldwater&#8217;s defeat in 1964, <i>National Review</i> rallied 
        conservatism behind the up-and-coming 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Ronald Reagan</span>. Buckley 
        parlayed his success with <i>National Review</i> into hosting 
        PBS&#8217;s <i>Firing Line</i> from 1966 to 1999.
    </li>
    <li class="list_item">
        <span class="label">Rolling Stone</span> (1967&ndash;present) was 
        founded in San Francisco as a rock and roll magazine, but it quickly 
        became notable for its experimental political journalism. In 1970 
        the magazine won acclaim for its pieces on the tragic 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Altamont Free Concert</span> and on 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Charles Manson</span> while he was 
        in jail awaiting trial. The magazine is indelibly associated with 
        the gonzo journalism of <span style="font-weight: bold;">Hunter S. 
        Thompson</span>&mdash;his seminal novel <i>Fear and Loathing in Las 
        Vegas</i> and the political piece <i style="font-weight: bold;">Fear 
        and Loathing on the Campaign Trail &#8217;72</i> first appeared in 
        Rolling Stone. After becoming more Hollywood-geared in the 1990s, 
        in the 2000s it re-oriented itself towards politics. In 2014 it 
        generated public outcry over its allegedly &#8220;glamorizing&#8221; 
        cover photo of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, one of the Boston Marathon bombers.
    </li>
    <li class="list_item">
        <span class="label">Ms.</span> (1971&ndash;present) is a pioneering 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">feminist</span> magazine, founded by 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Gloria Steinem</span> and 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Dorothy Pitman Hughes</span>. In its 
        first decade, it favored changes to common phrases and nouns to make 
        them gender-neutral. Its preview cover showed the goddess 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Kali</span> holding domestic objects 
        in her eight hands, while its first proper cover depicted 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Wonder Woman</span>. In 1972, before 
        <i>Roe v. Wade</i>, it ran an article about 53 women who admitted to 
        getting <span style="font-weight: bold;">abortions</span> despite it 
        still being illegal. While editor of Ms. in 1975, Alice Walker 
        published <span style="font-weight: bold;">&#8220;In Search of Zora 
        Neale Hurston&#8221;</span> after locating the author&#8217;s 
        unmarked grave.
