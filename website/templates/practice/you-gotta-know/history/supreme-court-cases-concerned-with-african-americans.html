    <li class="list_item">
        <span class="label">Dred Scott v. Sandford</span> (1857) determined 
        that people of African ancestry <span style="font-weight: bold;">did 
        not have the rights of citizens</span> in the United States. Dred 
        Scott was a slave who had been taken to Illinois and free parts of the 
        Louisiana Territory before being brought back to Missouri, and claimed 
        that being brought to free territory made him free. Chief Justice 
        Roger Taney ruled that African-Americans were not citizens and thus 
        did not have the right to bring a lawsuit in federal court. 
        Taney&#8217;s ruling further found that the 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Missouri Compromise was 
        unconstitutional</span> under the Property Clause. President James 
        Buchanan supported the Court&#8217;s decision in the case, which 
        was delivered two days after his inauguration. This ruling was later 
        overturned by the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Fourteenth 
        Amendment</span>.
    </li>
    <li class="list_item">
        <span class="label">Plessy v. Ferguson</span> (1896) determined that 
        state-imposed <span style="font-weight: bold;">segregation</span> 
        was legal. Homer Plessy was seven-eighths white, but he was not 
        allowed on a whites-only car on a Louisiana train. He claimed that 
        forced segregation violated his Fourteenth Amendment right to 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">&#8220;equal protection of the 
        laws.&#8221;</span> Justice Henry Brown wrote that segregation was 
        acceptable as long as there was no clear difference in quality 
        between the railway cars, which is often referred to with the phrase 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">&#8220;separate but equal.&#8221;
        </span> Justice <span style="font-weight: bold;">John Marshall Harlan
        </span> was the lone dissenter in the 8&ndash;1 decision; in his 
        dissenting opinion, he stated <span style="font-weight: bold;">
        &#8220;[o]ur Constitution is color-blind.&#8221;</span> <i>Plessy
        </i> was effectively overturned by <i>Brown v. Board of Education</i>.
    </li>
    <li class="list_item">
        <span class="label">Powell v. Alabama</span> (1932) determined that 
        defendants must be given legal counsel in a way that gives counsel 
        enough time to do their job. This case was brought by nine young 
        African-Americans, known as the <span style="font-weight: bold;">
        Scottsboro Boys</span>, eight of whom had been covincted of rape 
        and sentenced to death. The Court held that the Fourteenth 
        Amendment&#8217;s <span style="font-weight: bold;">Due Process 
        Clause</span> required states&mdash;in cases where the 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">death penalty</span> was a 
        possibility&mdash;to inform defendants that they had a right to 
        counsel, to appoint an attorney to represent defendants who could 
        not afford one, and to do so in a manner that allowed the appointed 
        attorney adequate time to prepare a defense (a requirement later 
        expanded in <i style="font-weight: bold;">Gideon v. Wainwright</i>). 
        Eventually, the rape victims recanted their story; some of the 
        defendants were convicted anyways. Three years after ruling in <i>
        Powell</i>, the Court ruled in the related case of 
        <i style="font-weight: bold;">Norris v. Alabama</i> (1935) that 
        Black people could not be systematically excluded from juries.
    </li>
    <li class="list_item">
        <span class="label">Shelley v. Kraemer</span> (1948) determined that 
        racially restrictive <span style="font-weight: bold;">housing 
        covenants</span> could not be enforced by courts. Louis Kraemer was 
        a white person in a white neighborhood in St. Louis that did not allow 
        residents to sell their houses to African-Americans or Asian-Americans. 
        The Shelleys were an African-American family that bought a house in 
        the neighborhood. Chief Justice Fred Vinson determined that any state 
        action enforcing the covenant would be discriminatory, and would 
        therefore violate the Fourteenth Amendment. The case was decided 
        6&ndash;0, with three justices recusing themselves because they had 
        racially restrictive housing covenants for their own houses. The 
        creation of racially restrictive housing covenants was outlawed by the 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Fair Housing Act of 1968</span>. An 
        important precursor to the Shelley decision was the 1940 case 
        <i style="font-weight: bold;">Hansberry v. Lee</i>, brought by the 
        father of Lorraine Hansberry, the author of <i>A Raisin in the Sun</i>.
    </li>
    <li class="list_item">
        <span class="label">Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka</span> (1954) 
        determined that <span style="font-weight: bold;">racially segregated 
        schools</span> were unconstitutional. <i>Brown</i> was actually only 
        one of a set of consolidated cases brought by African-Americans in 
        multiple states, all of which were decided along with <i>Brown</i>. 
        In all of those cases, African-Americans were turned down when they 
        tried to enroll their children in white-only schools. 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Thurgood Marshall</span>, who 
        later became the <span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>first 
        Black Supreme Court justice</span>, argued the case for the families. 
        Though many lower courts ruled for the schools, based on the 
        &#8220;separate but equal&#8221; doctrine established in <i>Plessy
        </i>, Chief Justice Earl Warren wrote a unanimous decision stating 
        that segregated schools are <span style="font-weight: bold;">
        inherently unequal</span> and therefore a violation of the Fourteenth 
        Amendment. In a ruling the next year, the Supreme Court determined 
        that school integration should occur <span style="font-weight: bold;">
        &#8220;with all deliberate speed.&#8221;</span> This inexact wording 
        led many districts in the South to stall the implementation of 
        integration as long as possible.
    </li>
    <li class="list_item">
        <span class="label">Bailey v. Patterson</span> (1962) determined that 
        African-Americans had the right to nonsegregated transportation 
        services. This case was brought after the arrest of the 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Freedom Riders</span>, who went to 
        the South in 1961 to protest continuing segregation. Sam Bailey was 
        an African-American civil rights activist who worked with Medgar 
        Evers, and Joe Patterson was the Attorney General of Mississippi. 
        The Supreme Court ruled <i>per curiam</i> that transportation 
        services should already be unsegregated according to the law 
        (calling the question &#8220;so well settled that it is foreclosed 
        as a litigable issue&#8221;) and that the federal judiciary in 
        Mississippi should enforce this.
    </li>
    <li class="list_item">
        <span class="label">Heart of Atlanta Motel v. United States</span> 
        (1964) determined that the United States could end racial 
        discrimination in public accommodations. As soon as the 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Civil Rights Act of 1964</span> 
        was passed, Moreton Rolleston Jr. filed a lawsuit claiming that 
        he was allowed to prevent African-Americans from staying at his 
        motel. The Supreme Court decided unanimously that the 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Commerce Clause</span> in 
        Article&nbsp;I of the Constitution allowed the federal government 
        to desegregate hotels and motels because those businesses are 
        impacted by interstate travel, as part of a judicial trend over 
        the 20th century which widened the scope of the Commerce Clause. 
        The plot of land where the Heart of Atlanta Motel once stood is now 
        occupied by the Atlanta Hilton.
    </li>
    <li class="list_item">
        <span class="label">Loving v. Virginia</span> (1967) determined that 
        states could not ban <span style="font-weight: bold;">interracial 
        marriages</span>, striking down <span style="font-weight: bold;">
        anti-miscegenation</span> laws.  Richard Loving, a white man, 
        married Mildred Jeter, who was African-American, in Washington, D.C. 
        When the couple moved to Virginia, they were in violation of the 
        state&#8217;s Racial Integrity Act of 1924, and they were told they 
        would either have to spend a year in prison or leave the state. 
        When that decision was upheld by the Virginia Supreme Court, the 
        U.S. Supreme Court determined that the Virginia law violated the 
        Fourteenth Amendment, as its only purpose was racial discrimination. 
        The couple remained married and in Virginia. Richard Loving was 
        killed by a drunk driver in 1975. Mildred Loving died in 2008; the 
        year before her death, she issued a statement of support for extending 
        the ruling in Loving to allow same-sex couples to wed, as well.
    </li>
    <li class="list_item">
        <span class="label">Regents of the University of California v. Bakke
        </span> (1978) determined that public systems could 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">take race into account</span>, 
        but could not set specific <span style="font-weight: bold;">racial 
        quotas</span>, in determining who, to admit to a university, thus 
        upholding <span style="font-weight: bold;">affirmative action</span>. 
        Allan Bakke was a white person who was rejected from the University 
        of California Medical School at Davis. The medical school set aside 
        sixteen positions each year for minorities, and Bakke contended that 
        he was more qualified than the minorities. The decision was confusing, 
        with Justice <span style="font-weight: bold;">Lewis Powell</span> 
        being the only justice who was both for using race as a criterion and 
        against quotas. Four other justices supported the use of quotas, 
        and the remaining four were against all affirmative action. Bakke 
        was admitted to the medical school; he eventually became an 
        anesthesiologist in Minnesota.
    </li>
    <li class="list_item">
        <span class="label">Grutter v. Bollinger</span> (2003) determined that 
        affirmative action programs whose <span style="font-weight: bold;">
        purpose is to increase diversity</span> are legal. Barbara Grutter 
        was a white applicant to the University of Michigan Law School who 
        was denied, and Lee Bollinger was the university president. On the 
        same day, the Supreme Court ruled on <i style="font-weight: bold;">
        Gratz v. Bollinger</i>, which addressed undergraduate admissions at 
        Michigan. In that case, the Supreme Court ruled that the 
        undergraduate affirmative action program was unconstitutional because 
        it was based on a <span style="font-weight: bold;">point system
        </span> rather than a <span style="font-weight: bold;">holistic look
        </span> at applicants. Together, these decisions were viewed as 
        upholding the Bakke decision made earlier. These cases were later 
        strengthened by two <i style="font-weight: bold;">Fisher v. 
        University of Texas</i> cases, in 2013 and 2016. At the time of <i>
        Grutter</i>, Justice <span style="font-weight: bold;">Sandra Day 
        O&#8217;Connor</span> remarked &#8220;We expect that 25 years from 
        now, the use of racial preferences will no longer be necessary to 
        further the interest [in student body diversity] approved 
        today.&#8221;
