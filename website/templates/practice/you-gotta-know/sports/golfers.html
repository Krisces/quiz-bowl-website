<ul class="list2">
    <li class="list_item">
        <span class="label">Tiger Woods</span> (1975&ndash;present) Born to 
        an African-American father and a Thai mother, he appeared on <i>The 
        Mike Douglas Show</i> with a golf club at age two. Woods won 
        three straight U.S. Junior Amateurs, and then became the only 
        golfer to win three straight U.S. Amateurs (1994&ndash;1996). 
        In 1997 Woods became the <span style="font-weight: bold;">youngest 
        ever to win the Masters</span>&mdash;by a whopping 12 strokes. 
        At the 2000 U.S.&nbsp;Open, when he won by 15 strokes, Woods began 
        a remarkable run of <span style="font-weight: bold;">four straight 
        major championships</span>:  British Open (by eight strokes, making 
        him the <span style="font-weight: bold;">youngest ever to complete 
        the career Grand Slam</span>), PGA Championship, and the 2001 Masters. 
        He accumulated 14 major wins by 2008, when his career was derailed by 
        injuries and personal issues, including infidelities leading to a 
        highly publicized separation from his former wife. His long-awaited 
        comeback reached its peak in 2019 when he won the Masters, his 15th 
        major title.
    </li>
	<li class="list_item">
        <span class="label">Jack Nicklaus</span> (1940&ndash;present) 
        Nicknamed &#8220;The Golden Bear,&#8221; he won the U.S. Amateur 
        twice (1959 and 1961), and was the 1961 NCAA champion at Ohio State. 
        He took his first major the following year at the U.S. Open, beating 
        Arnold Palmer on Palmer&#8217;s home course. Nicklaus became the 
        youngest Masters champion at the time in 1963, and 23 years later 
        became the oldest champion with a final round 65 in 1986. He has a 
        record <span style="font-weight: bold;">18 major pro championships
        </span> overall, including six Masters, five PGA Championships, 
        four U.S. Opens, and three British Opens.  Nicklaus is still somewhat 
        active on the Senior PGA Tour, and as a golf course architect.
    </li>
	<li class="list_item">
        <span class="label">Arnold Palmer</span> (1929&ndash;2016) A native 
        of Latrobe, Pennsylvania, Palmer made golf popular with the masses, 
        as his fans were known as <span style="font-weight: bold;">
        &#8220;Arnie&#8217;s Army.&#8221;</span> He won 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">seven majors</span>, including 
        four Masters, and was the first golfer to earn one million dollars 
        on the PGA Tour. Later Palmer became one of the stars of the Senior 
        Tour, winning the Senior PGA Open in 1980 and 1981. In 2002 he 
        played in his last competitive Masters.
    </li>
	<li class="list_item">
        <span class="label">Ben Hogan</span> (1912&ndash;1997) The PGA 
        Tour&#8217;s leading money winner from 1940&ndash;1942 and in 1946 
        and 1948, two events interrupted his playing career: service in World 
        War II and a near-fatal 1949 head-on car accident. After each, 
        though, Hogan rose to the top of his game; he won 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">nine majors overall</span> (six 
        after the accident), including four U.S. Opens. In 1953 he 
        accomplished a feat matched only by Tiger Woods: winning 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">three modern major championships 
        in one season</span> (the Masters, U.S. Open, and British Open).
        </li>
	<li class="list_item">
        <span class="label">Robert Tyre &#8220;Bobby&#8221; Jones</span> 
        (1902&ndash;1971) An Atlanta native, and the greatest amateur golfer 
        of all time, Jones <span style="font-weight: bold;">never turned pro
        </span>, but won thirteen major championships in eight years, 
        including four U.S. Amateurs.  In 1930 he won what was then 
        considered the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Grand Slam</span>, 
        taking both the British and U.S. Amateur and Open Championships. 
        After that season, Jones retired from golf to practice law, but 
        helped design a golf course in Augusta, Georgia that became the 
        permanent site of the Masters in 1934.
    </li>
	<li class="list_item">
        <span class="label">Sam Snead</span> (1912&ndash;2002) No golfer 
        has won more PGA Tournaments than Snead&#8217;s 81, and he amassed 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">135 victories worldwide</span>. 
        Nicknamed &#8220;Slammin&#8217; Sammy,&#8221; he won 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">seven major professional 
        championships</span> between 1942 and 1954, but he is known more 
        for the one he never won: the U.S. Open. In 1939 Snead led the Open 
        for 71 holes but lost on the last hole when he took an eight. 
        In the 1960s and &#8217;70s he won a record 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">six Senior PGA Championships</span>.
    </li>
	<li class="list_item">
        <span class="label">Tom Watson</span> (1949&ndash;present) He became 
        the major rival to <span style="font-weight: bold;">Jack Nicklaus
        </span> in the second half of the Golden Bear&#8217;s career. 
        Watson&#8217;s greatest achievements were at the British Open, a 
        tournament he won five times between 1975 and 1983. He took 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">eight major championships overall
        </span>.
    </li>
	<li class="list_item">
        <span class="label">Lee Trevino</span> (1939&ndash;present) Nicknamed 
        &#8220;Supermex&#8221; for his Mexican-American heritage, Trevino 
        came from a poor Dallas family and served in the Marines, but came 
        from nowhere to win the <span style="font-weight: bold;">1968 U.S. 
        Open</span>. He won <span style="font-weight: bold;">six majors
        </span>: the U.S. Open, the British Open, and the PGA Championship 
        twice each, his second PGA in 1984 at age 44. That last win was 
        most impressive because it came after the 1975 Western Open, where 
        Trevino was <span style="font-weight: bold;">struck by lightning
        </span> on the golf course.
    </li>
	<li class="list_item">
        <span class="label">Gary Player</span> (1935&ndash;present) The most 
        successful non-American golfer in history, this 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">South African</span> has won nine 
        majors. When Player took his only U.S. Open crown in 1965, he not 
        only became the first non-American to win that tournament in 
        45&nbsp;years, but he also became one of three (now five) golfers 
        (along with Nicklaus, Woods, Hogan, and Gene Sarazen) to win 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">all four modern Grand Slam events
        </span>. Nicknames include <span style="font-weight: bold;">
        &#8220;The Black Knight&#8221;</span> for his dress and 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">&#8220;Mr.&nbsp;Fitness&#8221;
        </span> for his devotion to exercise.
    </li>>
	<li class="list_item">
        <span class="label">Phil Mickelson</span> (1970&ndash;present) Known 
        as &#8220;Lefty&#8221; due to his swing (though he is naturally 
        right-handed), Phil Mickelson won The Masters in 2004, 2006, and 
        2010, and has also won a PGA Championship and British Open. Though 
        he has <span style="font-weight: bold;">never reached number&nbsp;1
        </span> in the World Golf Ranking, Mickelson was a constant force 
        during the 2000s, finishing <span style="font-weight: bold;">second 
        in the U.S.&nbsp;Open six times</span>. In 2018, Mickelson won 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">&#8220;The Match,&#8221;</span> 
        a pay-per-view event against Tiger Woods using the match play format; 
        the win earned Mickelson $9&nbsp;million.
    </li>
	<li class="list_item">
        <span class="label">Rory McIlroy</span> (1989&ndash;present) McIlroy 
        won his first major championship at the U.S.&nbsp;Open in 2011, and 
        despite being just 22 years old, he finished at 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">16 strokes under par</span>, a 
        record for the tournament. He won three more majors in the following 
        three years, and became the <span style="font-weight: bold;">
        top-ranked golfer in the world in 2012</span>; after doing so, he 
        and Luke Donald took turns at the top spot for over a year. He 
        briefly regained the top ranking in 2020, a year in which he and 
        Dustin Johnson raised over &pound;1.5&nbsp;million for coronavirus 
        relief in a televised skins game. Though he is from 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Northern Ireland</span>, McIlroy 
        has expressed interest in competing for 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Ireland</span> in international 
        competition instead of the U.K.
    </li>
	<li class="list_item">
        <span class="label">Jordan Spieth</span> (1993&ndash;present) In 
        2015, the year he turned 22, Spieth won both the Masters and the 
        U.S.&nbsp;Open, and finished second at the PGA Championship. His 
        Masters win was the first in which the same golfer lead after all 
        four days since Raymond Floyd did it in 1976, and it included an 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">8-under-par opening day</span> and 
        a record-tying <span style="font-weight: bold;">18-under-par result
        </span> for the tournament. Spieth has struggled more in recent 
        years, failing to win any PGA Tour events since his British Open 
        win in July 2017.
