        <i class="label">The Ed Sullivan Show</i></a> (1948&ndash;1971): This long-running CBS variety show occupied the same time slot &mdash; Sunday night at 8&nbsp;pm &mdash; for over two decades.  For most of that time, it broadcast live from what is now called the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Ed Sullivan Theater</span> on Broadway, which is currently the home of the <i style="font-weight: bold;">Late Show with Stephen Colbert</i>.  Among the characters it bequeathed to American popular culture were a Spanish ventriloquist known as <span style="font-weight: bold;">&#8220;Se&ntilde;or Wences&#8221;</span> and an Italian mouse puppet named <span style="font-weight: bold;">Topo Gigio</span>.  In 1964, the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Beatles</span> appeared on the show for three straight weeks, appearances which are credited with launching the <span style="font-weight: bold;">&#8220;British Invasion&#8221;</span> in popular music.</li>

        font-size: large;" target="_blank" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0043208"><i class="label">I Love Lucy</i></a> (1951&ndash;1957):  During its six-season run, <i>I Love Lucy</i> was one of America&#8217;s most watched shows.  It centered on <span style="font-weight: bold;">Lucy Ricardo</span>, played by comedian <span style="font-weight: bold;">Lucille Ball</span>, and her husband <span style="font-weight: bold;">Ricky Ricardo</span>, who was played by Ball&#8217;s real-life husband <span style="font-weight: bold;">Desi Arnaz</span>.  The show&#8217;s other major characters were the Ricardos&#8217; neighbors, <span style="font-weight: bold;">Fred</span> and <span style="font-weight: bold;">Ethel Mertz</span>.  In one of the show&#8217;s most famous episodes, Lucy was hired to do a TV commercial for a health tonic called <span style="font-weight: bold;">&#8220;Vitameatavegamin&#8221;</span>; after drinking too much of it, Lucy becomes <span style="font-weight: bold;">inebriated</span> and is unable to pronounce the word correctly.</li>

        font-size: large;" target="_blank" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0042114"><i class="label">The Honeymooners</i></a> (1955&ndash;1956):  <i>The Honeymooners</i> is considered the <span style="font-weight: bold;">first TV spinoff</span>, as it centered on a character &mdash; Brooklyn bus driver <span style="font-weight: bold;">Ralph Kramden</span> &mdash; who had previously been introduced on <i style="font-weight: bold;">The Jackie Gleason Show</i>.  Ralph&#8217;s wife <span style="font-weight: bold;">Alice</span> was frequently the recipient of his bombastic threats, such as <span style="font-weight: bold;">&#8220;Bang zoom, straight to the moon!&#8221;</span>.  Like <i style="font-weight: bold;">I Love Lucy</i>, the show also centrally featured a neighbor couple &mdash; in this case, <span style="font-weight: bold;">Ed</span> and <span style="font-weight: bold;">Trixie Norton</span>.  Although <i>The Honeymooners</i> is now considered a classic sitcom, it was not very popular at the time, and only 39 episodes aired in its original one-season run.</li>

        font-size: large;" target="_blank" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0047736/"><i class="label">Gunsmoke</i></a> (1955&ndash;1975): With 635&nbsp;episodes that aired over 20&nbsp;seasons, <i>Gunsmoke</i> was the <span style="font-weight: bold;">longest-running prime-time series in American television history</span> until <i style="font-weight: bold;">The Simpsons</i> overtook it.  Set in <span style="font-weight: bold;">Dodge City, Kansas</span> in the late 19th century, it centered on U.S. marshal <span style="font-weight: bold;">Matt Dillon</span>.  For several seasons in the early 1960s, it featured a young <span style="font-weight: bold;">Burt Reynolds</span> as the blacksmith <span style="font-weight: bold;">Quint Asper</span>.</li>

        font-size: large;" target="_blank" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0054557"><i class="label">Mr.&nbsp;Ed</i></a> (1958&ndash;1966):  This classic sitcom centered on the title <span style="font-weight: bold;">talking horse</span> &mdash; a palomino whose voice was provided by <span style="font-weight: bold;">Allan Lane</span> &mdash; and his owner, the architect <span style="font-weight: bold;">Wilbur Post</span>.  Much of the show&#8217;s humor derived from the fact that Mr.&nbsp;Ed would solely speak to Wilbur, which naturally led to hijinks.  Mr.&nbsp;Ed should not be confused with <span style="font-weight: bold;">Francis the Talking Mule</span>, who would solely speak to his owner <span style="font-weight: bold;">Peter Stirling</span>; he appeared in a number of film comedies during the 1950s.</li>

        font-size: large;" target="_blank" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0052520"><i class="label">The Twilight Zone</i></a> (1959&ndash;1964): Rod Serling created this anthology series, whose iconic opening credits featured a theme composed by <span style="font-weight: bold;">Bernard Herrmann</span> and a narration warning that the viewer was <span style="font-weight: bold;">&#8220;about to enter another dimension.&#8221;</span>  One of its most famous episodes, <span style="font-weight: bold;">&#8220;Nightmare at 20,000 Feet,&#8221;</span> starred a young <span style="font-weight: bold;">William Shatner</span> as a salesman who becomes convinced that a <span style="font-weight: bold;">gremlin nobody else can see</span> is trying to crash the airplane on which he is flying.</li>

        font-size: large;" target="_blank" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0053479"><i class="label">The Andy Griffith Show</i></a> (1960&ndash;1968): One of the most popular TV series of its decade, <i>The Andy Griffith Show</i> starred its title actor as <span style="font-weight: bold;">Andy Taylor</span>, the <span style="font-weight: bold;">sheriff</span> in the sleepy small town of <span style="font-weight: bold;">Mayberry, North Carolina</span>.  The show is almost as well known for its distinctive supporting characters, including a <span style="font-weight: bold;">gas station attendant</span> named <span style="font-weight: bold;">Gomer Pyle</span> and Andy&#8217;s awkward <span style="font-weight: bold;">deputy sheriff</span>, <span style="font-weight: bold;">Barney Fife</span>.  <span style="font-weight: bold;">Ron Howard</span> rose to fame as a child actor on the show, playing Andy&#8217;s son <span style="font-weight: bold;">Opie</span>, before going on to an adult career as a prolific actor and director.</li>

        font-size: large;" target="_blank" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0065314"><i class="label">The Mary Tyler Moore Show</i></a> (1970&ndash;1977): This sitcom centered on <span style="font-weight: bold;">Mary Richards</span>, a young woman who moves to Minneapolis, where she goes to work in the <span style="font-weight: bold;">newsroom</span> at <span style="font-weight: bold;">WJM-TV</span>.  No fewer than three supporting characters eventually got their own <span style="font-weight: bold;">spinoffs</span>: <i style="font-weight: bold;">Phyllis</i>, which starred <span style="font-weight: bold;">Cloris Leachman</span>; <i style="font-weight: bold;">Rhoda</i>, which starred <span style="font-weight: bold;">Valerie Harper</span>; and <i style="font-weight: bold;">Lou Grant</i>, which &mdash; unlike both the other two spinoffs and <i>The Mary Tyler Moore Show</i> itself &mdash; was a <span style="font-weight: bold;">drama</span> rather than a sitcom.  The show is considered groundbreaking for its portrayal of Mary as an <span style="font-weight: bold;">independent single woman</span>.</li>
	<li class="list_item">
        <a style="color: maroon; font-family: Cambria; font-weight: bold; 
        font-size: large;" target="_blank" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0066626"><i class="label">All in the Family</i></a> (1971&ndash;1979): Producer <span style="font-weight: bold;">Norman Lear</span> created this sitcom, which was based on the successful British series <i style="font-weight: bold;">Till Death Us Do Part</i>.  It starred <span style="font-weight: bold;">Carroll O&#8217;Connor</span> and <span style="font-weight: bold;">Jean Stapleton</span> as the central couple, <span style="font-weight: bold;">Archie</span> and <span style="font-weight: bold;">Edith Bunker</span>; Archie was notable for his prejudicial attitudes, while Edith &mdash; whom Archie would refer to as his <span style="font-weight: bold;">&#8220;dingbat&#8221;</span> &mdash; was his long-suffering wife.  The show also featured <span style="font-weight: bold;">Sherman Hemsley</span> as <span style="font-weight: bold;">George Jefferson</span>, who would later be given his own spinoff, <i style="font-weight: bold;">The Jeffersons</i>, in which he and his wife <span style="font-weight: bold;">&#8220;moved on up to a deluxe apartment in the sky&#8221;</span> on the East Side of Manhattan.</li>

        <a style="color: maroon; font-family: Cambria; font-weight: bold; 
        font-size: large;" target="_blank" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0068098"><i class="label">M*A*S*H</i></a> (1972&ndash;1983): Like <i>The Mary Tyler Moore Show</i> and <i>All in the Family</i>, <i>M*A*S*H</i> was a highly successful CBS sitcom that dealt with controversial social issues &mdash; in this case, war.  Centering on the <span style="font-weight: bold;">4077th Mobile Army Surgical Hospital</span> in <span style="font-weight: bold;">South Korea</span>, it was adapted from the 1970 feature film of the same name directed by <span style="font-weight: bold;">Robert Altman</span>.  Major characters included <span style="font-weight: bold;">Hawkeye Pierce</span>, a <span style="font-weight: bold;">wisecracking surgeon</span> played by <span style="font-weight: bold;">Alan Alda</span>; <span style="font-weight: bold;">Sherman Potter</span>, who was added to the show in season&nbsp;4 after the previous commanding officer, <span style="font-weight: bold;">Henry Blake</span>, was killed off; and <span style="font-weight: bold;">Corporal Klinger</span>, who would <span style="font-weight: bold;">dress in women&#8217;s clothing</span> in an attempt to be discharged from the army.</li>
