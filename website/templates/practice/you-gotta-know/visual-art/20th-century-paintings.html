    This list focuses on individual paintings rather than bodies of work; thus, for example, <a style="color: maroon; font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_O%27Keeffe">Georgia O&#8217;Keeffe</a> is not included because no specific one of her familiar <span style="font-weight: bold;"><a style="color: maroon;" target="_blank" href="http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/works-of-art/52.203">cowskull</a>-and-<a style="color: maroon;" target="_blank" href="http://www.georgiaokeeffe.org/flowers/">flower</a> paintings</span> is sufficiently prominent.  The list is notably skewed toward the first half of the 20th century; only one work on it was painted after 1950.  Perhaps the earlier paintings have simply had more time to be influential and make their way into the artistic canon.  Also, many prominent post-1950 painters, like <a style="color: maroon; font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackson_Pollock">Jackson Pollock</a> and <a style="color: maroon; font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Rothko">Mark Rothko</a>, do not have a specific work with a catchy title that has gained particular attention above all others; like O&#8217;Keeffe, they are known for their style and collective body of work rather than for any one painting.

        target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pablo_Picasso">
        Pablo Picasso</a>. Guernica was a <span style="font-weight: bold;">
        Basque</span> town bombed by the Germans during the 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Spanish Civil War</span> in April 
        1937. Picasso had already been commissioned to paint a mural for the 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Spanish Pavilion</span> at the 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">World&#8217;s Fair</span>, and he 
        completed his massive, black, white, and grey anti-war mural by 
        early June 1937. Picasso&#8217;s <span style="font-weight: bold;">
        Cubist</span> approach to portraying the figures adds to the sense of 
        destruction and chaos. <i>Guernica</i> was in the 
        <a style="color: maroon; font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" 
        href="http://www.moma.org">Museum of Modern Art</a> (MOMA) in New

        href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcel_Duchamp">Marcel Duchamp</a>. 
        <i>Nude Descending a Staircase</i> was painted in 1912 and created a 
        sensation when shown at the <a style="color: maroon; 
        font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/
        wiki/Armory_Show">1913 Armory Show</a> in New York, where one critic 
        referred to it as <span style="font-weight: bold;">&#8220;an 
        explosion in a shingle factory.&#8221;</span> Painted in various 
        shades of brown, <i>Nude Descending a Staircase</i> portrays a nude 
        person in a series of broken planes, capturing motion down several 
        steps in a single image. The painting reflects a 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Cubist</span> sense of division of 
        space, and its portrait of motion echoes the work of the 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Futurists</span>.

        href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvador_Dal%C3%AD">Salvador 
        Dal&iacute;</a>. First shown in 1931, <i>The Persistence of Memory
        </i> is probably the most famous <span style="font-weight: bold;">
        surrealist</span> painting. The landscape of the scene echoes the area 
        around <span style="font-weight: bold;">Portlligat</span>, 
        Dal&iacute;&#8217;s home. The ants, flies, clocks, and the Portlligat 
        landscape are motifs in many other Dal&iacute; paintings, and the 
        <i style="font-weight: bold;">trompe l&#8217;oeil</i> depiction of 
        figures is typical of his works. It currently belongs to the

        href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pablo_Picasso">Pablo Picasso</a>. 
        This painting depicts five women in a brothel. However, the images of 
        the women are partly broken into disjointed, angular facets. The 
        degree of broken-ness is rather mild compared to later 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Cubist</span> works, but it was 
        revolutionary in 1907.  The rather phallic fruit arrangement in the 
        foreground reflects the influence of <span style="font-weight: bold;">
        Paul C&eacute;zanne</span>&#8217;s <span style="font-weight: bold;">
        &#8220;flattening of the canvas.&#8221;</span> The two central 
        figures face the viewer, while the other three have primitive masks 
        as faces, reflecting another of Picasso&#8217;s influences. It is 
        currently housed at the <a style="color: maroon;

        While <i style="font-weight: bold;">Les Demoiselles d&#8217;Avignon
        </i> and other Cubist paintings represent an extension of 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Paul C&eacute;zanne</span>&#8217;s 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">division-of-space</span> approach 
        to the canvas, Mondrian&#8217;s <span style="font-weight: bold;">
        De&nbsp;Stijl</span> works are a still further abstraction, such that 
        the canvas is often divided up into rectangular &#8220;tile patterns,
        &#8221; as in <a style="color: maroon;" target="_blank" 
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composition_with_Red_Blue_and_
        Yellow"><i style="font-weight: bold;">Composition with Red Blue and 
        Yellow</i></a>. The painting simultaneously echoes the bright lights 
        of a marquee, resembles a pattern of streets as seen from above, and 
        creates a feeling of vitality and vibrancy, not unlike the music 
        itself. This work can also be found at the <a style="color: maroon;

        perhaps reflects) a world in which celebrities, brand names, and 
        media images have replaced the sacred; Warhol&#8217;s series of <i>
        Campbell&#8217;s Soup</i> paintings may be the best illustration of 
        this. Like the object itself, the paintings were often done by the 
        mass-produceable form of <span style="font-weight: bold;">serigraphy
        </span> (silk screening). Also like the subject, the Warhol soup can 
        painting existed in many varieties, with different types of soup or 
        numbers of cans; painting 32 or 100 or 200 identical cans further 
        emphasized the aspect of mass production in the work. The same 
        approach underlies Warhol&#8217;s familiar series of prints of 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Marilyn Monroe</span>, 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis</span>, 
        and other pop culture figures.

        href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Hopper">Edward Hopper</a>. 
        As is often the case with his works, Hopper uses a realistic 
        approach (including such details as the fluorescent light of the 
        diner, the coffee pots, and the <span style="font-weight: bold;">
        Phillies cigar sign</span> atop the diner) to convey a sense of a 
        loneliness and isolation, even going so far as to depict the corner 
        store without a door connecting to the larger world. Hopper&#8217;s 
        wife <span style="font-weight: bold;">Jo</span> served as the model 
        for the woman at the bar. <i>Nighthawks</i> is housed at the

        href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_Chagall">Marc Chagall</a>. 
        Painted in 1911, <i>I and the Village</i> is among Chagall&#8217;s 
        earliest surviving paintings. It is a dreamlike scene that includes 
        many motifs common to Chagall, notably the lamb and peasant life. 
        In addition to the two giant faces&mdash;a green face on the right 
        and a lamb&#8217;s head on the left&mdash;other images include a 
        milkmaid, a reaper, an upside-down peasant woman, a church, and a 
        series of houses, some of them <span style="font-weight: bold;">
        upside-down</span>. <i>I and the Village</i> is currently housed at

        <a style="color: maroon; font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" 
        href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Wyeth">Andrew Wyeth</a>. 
        The Christina of the title is <span style="font-weight: bold;">
        Christina Olson</span>, who lived near the Wyeths&#8217; summer 
        home in <span style="font-weight: bold;">Cushing, Maine</span>. 
        In the 1948 painting, Christina lays in the cornfield wearing a pink 
        dress, facing away from the viewer, her body partly twisted and hair 
        blowing slightly in the wind. In the far distance is a three-story 
        farmhouse with dual chimneys and two dormers, along with two sheds 
        to its right.  A distant barn is near the top middle of the painting. 
        One notable aspect is the subtle pattern of sunlight, which strikes 
        the farmhouse obliquely from the right, shines in the wheel tracks 
        in the upper right, and casts very realistic-looking shadows on 
        Christina&#8217;s dress. The Olson house was the subject of many 
        Andrew Wyeth paintings for 30 years, and it was named to the 
        <a style="color: maroon;" target="_blank"

        href="http://www.crma.org/Content/Grant-Wood/Gallery.aspx">Grant 
        Wood</a>. Wood painted his most famous work after a visit to 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Eldon, Iowa</span>, when he saw a 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Carpenter Gothic</span>-style house 
        with a distinctive Gothic window in its gable. Upon returning to his 
        studio, he used his sister <span style="font-weight: bold;">Nan
        </span> and his <span style="font-weight: bold;">dentist, 
        Dr.&nbsp;Byron McKeeby</span>, as the models for the two figures. 
        The <span style="font-weight: bold;">pitchfork</span> and the 
        clothing were more typical of 19th-century farmers than contemporary 
        ones. <i>American Gothic</i> is among the most familiar 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">regionalist</span> paintings, and 
        it is said to be the most parodied of all paintings. It hangs at the 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Art Institute of Chicago</span>, 
        where it was submitted for a competition by Wood upon its completion 
        in 1930 (Wood won a bronze medal and a $300 prize).
