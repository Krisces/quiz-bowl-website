<dt>Burj Khalifa (Dubai, UAE; Adrian Smith, architect; completed 2009)</dt>
    <dd  style="margin-left: 1em;">
        As of 2019, the Burj Khalifa in Dubai, United Arab Emirates is both 
        the tallest building in the world and the tallest man-made structure 
        ever built. The structure was named in honor of 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Sheikh Khalifa</span>, the 
        president of the UAE. The burj&mdash;Arabic for 
        &#8220;tower&#8221;&mdash;is part of a complex in downtown Dubai that 
        also includes the world&#8217;s second-largest mall by area and one 
        of the world&#8217;s largest fountains. The building has three curved 
        wings in a &#8216;Y&#8217;-shape that act as 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">buttresses</span> supporting the 
        building&#8217;s massive height. That exact height, 2,722 feet, was 
        kept a closely-guarded secret until the building opened.

    Empire State Building (New York City; [Firm of] Shreve, Lamb, and Harmon, 
    architects; completed 1931)
</dt>
    <dd  style="margin-left: 1em;">
        The Empire State Building, which has a height of 1,250 feet (1,454 
        feet including antenna) surpassed the nearby 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Chrysler Building</span> to become 
        the tallest building in the world upon its 1931 completion, holding 
        that title for four decades until the construction of the original 
        World Trade Center. Following the 9/11 attacks, the building was once 
        again the tallest in New York. The Empire State Building, like the 
        Chrysler Building, is a classic example of 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Art Deco</span> architecture, an 
        early-20th-century style known for its streamlined, modern appearance. 
        The building is an iconic symbol of New York and pop culture, 
        appearing prominently in the film <i>King Kong</i>. Original plans for 
        the building included a mooring station for 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">zeppelins</span> at its apex, but 
        this never came to fruition.

<dt>
    Abraj Al-Bait (Mecca, Saudi Arabia; [Firms of] Dar Al-Handasah and SL 
    Rasch, architects; completed 2011)
</dt>
    <dd  style="margin-left: 1em;">
        The Saudi government funded construction of the Abraj Al-Bait 
        complex, a set of seven massive hotels whose central tower reaches 
        a height of 1,972 feet. The complex overlooks the 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Great Mosque of Mecca</span>, 
        which contains the <i style="font-weight: bold;">Kaaba</i> (the 
        holiest place in Islam) and was built to offer modern accommodations 
        to Muslims participating in the annual <i style="font-weight: bold;">
        Hajj</i>, or pilgrimage to Mecca. The Abraj Al-Bait, whose name 
        means &#8220;Tower of the House&#8221; in Arabic, contains the 
        world&#8217;s largest clock face (over 140 feet in diameter) and as 
        of 2019 is the world&#8217;s most expensive building, with 
        construction costs exceeding $15&nbsp;billion. The complex was built 
        by the Saudi <span style="font-weight: bold;">Binladin Group</span>, 
        a company founded by Osama bin Laden&#8217;s father.

    Shanghai Tower (Shanghai, China; Jun Xia, lead architect; 
    completed 2015)
</dt>
    <dd  style="margin-left: 1em;">
        When it opened in 2015, the Shanghai Tower&mdash;with a height of 
        2,073 feet&mdash;was the second-tallest building in the world, a 
        title it still holds as of 2019. The tower, which is located in 
        Shanghai&#8217;s Pudong District, is adjacent to both the 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Jin Mao Tower</span> and 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Shanghai World Financial Centre
        </span>, two of the world&#8217;s other tallest buildings. By far, 
        the tower&#8217;s most notable architectural feature is the fact that 
        the building twists as it ascends&mdash;the top of the building is 
        rotated approximately 120 degrees clockwise from the base. Its 
        118th floor is home to the second-highest observation deck in the 
        world; the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Ping An Financial Center
        </span> in Shenzhen, China has an observation deck about one foot 
        higher.

    One World Trade Center (New York City; David Childs, architect; 
    completed 2014)
</dt>
    <dd  style="margin-left: 1em;">
        Construction began on One World Trade Center, alternatively known as 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">1&nbsp;WTC</span> and the 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Freedom Tower</span>, in 2006, and 
        was the main part of the project of rebuilding the World Trade 
        Center following the <span style="font-weight: bold;">9/11 attacks
        </span> as part of an overall plan for the site developed by 
        architect <span style="font-weight: bold;">Daniel Libeskind</span>; 
        it occupies the former site of the original 6&nbsp;WTC. The building 
        reaches a symbolic height of <span style="font-weight: bold;">1,776 
        feet</span>, and is adjacent to a pair of 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">memorial reflecting pools</span> 
        marking the foundations of the original Twin Towers. The new WTC 
        complex includes a transportation hub designed by Spanish architect 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Santiago Calatrava</span>. A new 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Two World Trade Center</span> will 
        likely not be completed until 2024.

    Willis Tower (usually known as the Sears Tower; Chicago; Bruce Graham 
    and Fazlur Rahman Khan, architects on behalf of the firm Skidmore, 
    Owings and Merrill; completed 1973)
</dt>
    <dd  style="margin-left: 1em;">
        When it opened in Chicago, Illinois in 1973, the Willis Tower was 
        the tallest building in the world, with a height of 1,450 feet. The 
        building was originally (and is still commonly) known as the 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Sears Tower</span>, as it was built 
        as a new headquarters for Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co.; it was 
        officially renamed after the insurance company Willis Group Holdings, 
        Ltd., in 2009. The building&#8217;s design, inspired by a 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">pack of cigarettes</span>, consists 
        of a three-by-three set of &#8220;tubes&#8221; of varying heights. 
        The tower contains a 103rd-floor <span style="font-weight: bold;">
        &#8220;Skydeck&#8221;</span> from which as many as four U.S. states 
        (Illinois, Indiana, Wisconsin, and Michigan) are visible on a clear 
        day, and which also contains several glass balconies that extend out 
        from the building, allowing visitors to look straight down to the 
        street below.

<dt>The Shard (London, England; Renzo Piano, architect; completed 2013)</dt>
    <dd  style="margin-left: 1em;">
        The Shard, originally known as <span style="font-weight: bold;">
        London Bridge Tower</span>, is the tallest building in the U.K, with 
        a height of 1,016 feet. It gets its name from its appearance: the 
        glass-enclosed, pyramid-like structure tapers as it rises to a set 
        of points at the top, giving the impression of several shards of 
        glass leaning against one another. The Shard was designed by 
        Pritzker-winning Italian architect Renzo Piano, who also designed 
        Paris&#8217;s <span style="font-weight: bold;">Georges Pompidou 
        Center</span> and New York&#8217;s <span style="font-weight: bold;">
        Whitney Museum of Art</span>. Despite being in London, the tower is 
        primarily owned by the state of <span style="font-weight: bold;">
        Qatar</span> and is a broadcast headquarters for the English branch 
        of the Qatari media network <span style="font-weight: bold;">
        Al&nbsp;Jazeera</span>.

<dt>Taipei 101 (Taipei, Taiwan; Chu Yuan Lee, architect; completed 2004)</dt>
    <dd  style="margin-left: 1em;">
        Taipei 101, named for its 101 floors, was the tallest building in the 
        world when it opened in 2004, with a height of 1,674 feet; it lost 
        the title to the Burj Khalifa in 2010. The building was originally 
        known as the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Taipei World Financial 
        Center</span>. The main part of the structure consists of 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">eight</span> stacked sections of 
        eight floors each (Chinese numerology considers eight a lucky number); 
        those sections resemble both floors of a 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">pagoda</span> as well as ancient 
        Chinese <span style="font-weight: bold;">money boxes</span> (which 
        themselves inspired the design of modern Chinese take-out containers). 
        The upper floors of the building contain a 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">tuned mass damper</span>, a large 
        round structure that absorbs vibrations and keeps the building from 
        shaking during high winds and other inclement weather.

    Petronas Towers (Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia; C&eacute;sar Pelli, architect; 
    completed 1998)
</dt>
    <dd  style="margin-left: 1em;">
        The Petronas Towers are the world&#8217;s tallest 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">twin towers</span>, at 1,483 feet 
        each. Upon their completion, they surpassed the (at the time) Sears 
        Tower to become the tallest buildings in the world; they lost that 
        overall title to <span style="font-weight: bold;">Taipei 101</span> 
        in 2004. The towers are named for Petronas, Malyasia&#8217;s 
        government-owned petroleum and gas company, which is headquartered 
        in the towers. Architect Pelli designed the cross-section of the 
        towers to resemble the Islamic symbol of the 
        <i style="font-weight: bold;">Rub el&nbsp;Hizb</i>, while their 
        exteriors resemble an ancient <span style="font-weight: bold;">minaret
        </span>, a tower attached to a mosque from which a 
        <i style="font-weight: bold;">muezzin</i> issues a call to prayer. 
        The towers are connected by a <span style="font-weight: bold;">
        skybridge</span> on their 41st and 42nd floors, allowing visitors to 
        move between them. In the coming years, the towers will be exceeded 
        in height by two other Kuala Lumpur skyscrapers: the slightly taller 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Exchange 106</span> and the massive, 
        2,185-foot <span style="font-weight: bold;">PNB&nbsp;118</span>.

    St.&nbsp;Regis Chicago (formerly the Vista Tower; Chicago; Jeanne Gang, 
    architect; completed 2020)
</dt>
    <dd  style="margin-left: 1em;">
        Located near Chicago&#8217;s <span style="font-weight: bold;">Navy 
        Pier</span>, the St.&nbsp;Regis (commonly called by its name during 
        construction, the Vista Tower), is the third-tallest building in 
        Chicago (behind the Willis Tower and the Trump International Hotel 
        and Tower). It is also the tallest structure in the world designed 
        by a female architect; the previous holder of that title, 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Aqua</span>, is just a few blocks 
        from the Vista Tower and was also designed by Gang. The Vista 
        Tower&#8217;s design consists of three connected portions of 
        increasing height, with the tallest topping out at 1,191&nbsp;feet.
