        <span class="label">George Herman &#8220;Babe&#8221; Ruth</span> 
        (1895&ndash;1948; pitcher and outfield), the rough son of a saloon 
        keeper, grew up on the Baltimore waterfront and in the 
        St.&nbsp;Mary&#8217;s Industrial School for Boys.  Released after 
        signing a baseball contract with the minor-league Baltimore Orioles, 
        he was bought by the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Boston Red Sox
        </span> and played with them for six seasons, winning 89&nbsp;games 
        and three World Series, and, in 1919, setting a new 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">single-season home-run record
        </span>: 29.  Already famous as a player, 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">eater</span>, and 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">carouser</span>, Boston sold him to 
        New York for the 1920 season, where his fame became legend. Moved 
        from the pitcher&#8217;s mound to the outfield, he won nine 
        home-run titles and four World Series from 1920 to 1934. In 1927 he 
        hit <span style="font-weight: bold;">60 home runs</span> and led the 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">&#8220;Murderers&#8217; Row&#8221;
        </span> Yankee lineup to a sweep of the Pittsburgh Pirates in the 
        World Series.  He hit his controversial 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">&#8220;Called Shot&#8221;</span> 
        homer against the Cubs during the third game of the 1932 World 
        Series after allegedly gesturing towards the centerfield stands. 
        Since his retirement from baseball in 1935, many of his most famous 
        pitching and batting records have been surpassed, but power hitting 
        as a legitimate approach towards playing baseball continues. 
        Before Ruth, the homer was a rare occurrence.

	<li class="list_item">
        <span class="label">Lou Gehrig</span> (1903&ndash;1941; first base) 
        was born in Manhattan to German immigrants. A football and baseball 
        player at <span style="font-weight: bold;">Columbia University
        </span>, he signed with the Yankees in 1923. He became a regular 
        in 1925, replacing Wally Pipp at first base and beginning his 
        streak of <span style="font-weight: bold;">2130 consecutive games 
        played</span> (since broken by Cal Ripken&nbsp;Jr. in 1995) that 
        earned him the nickname <span style="font-weight: bold;">&#8220;The 
        Iron Horse.&#8221;</span> His batting feats include 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">184&nbsp;RBI</span> in 1931 
        (the AL record), <span style="font-weight: bold;">23 career grand 
        slams</span> (the ML record for many decades, since broken by Alex 
        Rodriguez), a <span style="font-weight: bold;">triple crown</span> 
        in 1934, and a <span style="font-weight: bold;">.340 career batting 
        average</span>. When it was discovered that he was suffering from 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">amyotrophic lateral sclerosis
        </span>&mdash;now commonly known as Lou Gehrig&#8217;s 
        disease&mdash;he delivered his famous 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">&#8220;Today, I consider myself 
        the luckiest man on the face of the Earth&#8221;</span> speech at 
        Yankee Stadium on July 4, 1939.  In deference to Lou, no Yankee was 
        appointed captain until Thurman Munson in 1976.
    </li>
	<li class="list_item">
        <span class="label">Joe DiMaggio</span> (1914&ndash;1999; center 
        field) left the <span style="font-weight: bold;">San Francisco Seals
        </span> of the Pacific Coast League and joined New York for the 
        1936 season, where he helped <span style="font-weight: bold;">Lou 
        Gehrig</span> drive the Yankees to their fifth championship and the 
        first of nine that he would win with the Bombers. 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">&#8220;The Yankee Clipper&#8221;
        </span> won <span style="font-weight: bold;">three Most Valuable 
            Player awards</span> (1939, 1941, 1947), 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">two batting titles</span> (1939, 
        1940), and <span style="font-weight: bold;">two homer titles</span> 
        (1937, 1948).  In 1941 <span style="font-weight: bold;">
        &#8220;Joltin&#8217; Joe&#8221;</span> 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">hit safely in 56 consecutive games
        </span>, a record that has never been challenged (he once hit in 61 
        straight for the Seals in 1933).  His career totals are abbreviated 
        because of his <span style="font-weight: bold;">military service
        </span> (1943&ndash;1945) and because of the distance to Yankee 
        Stadium&#8217;s left-field power alley, in those days known as Death 
        Valley. He <span style="font-weight: bold;">married Marilyn Monroe
        </span> in 1954, but they divorced after nine months.
    </li>
	<li class="list_item">
        <span class="label">Mickey Mantle</span> (1931&ndash;1995; center 
        field) was born to play baseball&mdash;his father 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">named him for Hall of Fame catcher 
        Mickey Cochrane</span>&mdash;but his left leg wasn&#8217;t. In high 
        school it was <span style="font-weight: bold;">nearly amputated
        </span> because of <span style="font-weight: bold;">osteomyelitis
        </span>, the first of his many leg problems. Known as the 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">&#8220;Commerce Comet&#8221;</span> 
        because of his speed and because he grew up in Commerce, Oklahoma, 
        he became the Yankee center fielder following DiMaggio&#8217;s 
        retirement in 1951. Mantle played on <span style="font-weight: bold;">
        twelve pennant winners</span> and <span style="font-weight: bold;">
        seven World Championship</span> clubs. He holds 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">World Series records</span> for 
        home runs (18), RBI (40), runs (42), walks (43), extra-base hits 
        (26), and total bases (123).  During the regular season, his 
        switch-hitting powered <span style="font-weight: bold;">536 home 
        runs</span> and won him <span style="font-weight: bold;">four 
        homer titles</span> (1955, 1956, 1958, 1960), 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">three MVP awards</span> (1956, 
        1957, 1962), and a <span style="font-weight: bold;">triple crown
        </span> (1956). In 1961 he and teammate 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Roger Maris</span> both had a 
        chance of passing Ruth&#8217;s 1927 mark (60), but injuries forced 
        him out of the race (Maris hit 61).  He was elected to the Hall of 
        Fame alongside Whitey Ford in 1974.
    </li>
	<li class="list_item">
        <span class="label">Yogi Berra</span> (1925&ndash;2015; catcher) was 
        notorious for <span style="font-weight: bold;">swinging at bad 
        pitches</span>, but his bat collided with them often enough to hit 
        a <span style="font-weight: bold;">catcher&#8217;s record 306 home 
        runs</span> that lasted for more than 30&nbsp;years (since passed 
        by Johnny Bench, Carlton Fisk, and Mike Piazza). His hitting, 
        fielding, and ability to lead the Yankee pitching staff earned him 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">three MVP awards</span> (1951, 
        1954, 1955).  He also starred in the World Series, collecting 71 
        hits while playing on <span style="font-weight: bold;">10 
        championship teams</span>, both records. Hired as 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Yankee manager</span> in 1964, 
        he led the Yanks to the pennant but was 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">fired</span> following their 
        Series loss to the Cardinals. His 1973 pennant with the 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Mets</span> made him the 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">only manager besides Joe McCarthy 
        to take home the flag in both leagues</span>. Like 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Casey Stengel</span>, he was famous 
        for his quotes, including <span style="font-weight: bold;">
        &#8220;It aint&#8217; over &#8217;til it&#8217;s over,&#8221;
        </span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">&#8220;It&#8217;s deja vu 
        all over again,&#8221;</span> and <span style="font-weight: bold;">
        &#8220;Little League baseball is a very good thing because it 
        keeps the parents off the streets.&#8221;</span>
    </li>
	<li class="list_item">
        <span class="label">Casey Stengel</span> (1889&ndash;1975; manager) 
        He <span style="font-weight: bold;">managed the Yankees</span> to 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">ten pennants</span> and 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">seven championships</span>, 
        including a record <span style="font-weight: bold;">five in a row
        </span> from 1949 to 1953. The <span style="font-weight: bold;">
        &#8220;Old Perfessor&#8221;</span> did not use a set lineup or 
        pitching rotation, instead using a bewildering number of 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">platoon arrangements</span>. 
        Somehow this did not undermine his defense, as Stengel&#8217;s 
        Yankees led the league in double plays six times. Remembered as 
        a player for his two game-winning home runs, one an inside-the-
        parker, against the Yankees in the 1923 World Series, off the 
        field his <span style="font-weight: bold;">vaudevillian personality
        </span> involved him in many famous incidents. When in 1958 he was 
        called in front of the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Senate 
        Subcommittee on Antitrust and Monopoly</span> to testify on why 
        baseball should be exempt from antitrust regulation, he testified 
        with an hour&#8217;s worth of classic &#8220;Stengelese.&#8221; 
        When the baffled politicians let Stengel go and called on Mickey 
        Mantle to answer their questions, he replied, &#8220;My views are 
        about the same as Casey&#8217;s.&#8221;
    </li>
	<li class="list_item">
        <span class="label">Reggie Jackson</span> (1946&ndash;present; right 
        field) Known as <span style="font-weight: bold;">&#8220;Mr. 
        October&#8221;</span> because of his World Series slugging, in the 
        sixth game of the 1977 World Series he hit 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">three home runs off three 
        different pitchers on three consecutive swings</span> of his bat.  
        He and Babe Ruth, who did it twice, are the only players to 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">homer three times in one World 
        Series game</span>. His .755 slugging average is the highest in 
        World Series history. Soon after joining the Yankees in 1977 he 
        created a sensation by proclaiming himself 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">&#8220;the straw that stirs the 
        drink.&#8221;</span> The wild atmosphere surrounding Jackson and 
        the Yankees was captured by a teammate in a book called 
        <i style="font-weight: bold;">The Bronx Zoo</i>. Jackson won 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">four home run titles</span> 
        (1973, 1975, 1980, 1983), hit <span style="font-weight: bold;">
        563 home runs</span>, and set a major-league 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">record for strikeouts</span> 
        (2,597).
    </li>
	<li class="list_item">
        <span class="label">Don Mattingly</span> (1961&ndash;present; first 
        base) was the best first baseman in baseball for most of the 
        1980&#8217;s. He holds the major league record for 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">most grand slams in a season
        </span> (6 in 1987, tied by Travis Hafner in 2006). He 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">twice led the league in hits
        </span> (1984 and 1985), won the league 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">batting title</span> by edging out 
        teammate Dave Winfield on the final day of the 1984 season, and 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">drove in the most runs</span> in 
        1985 to win the MVP award. <span style="font-weight: bold;">
        &#8220;Donnie Baseball&#8221;</span> also won 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">nine Gold Gloves</span>, but World 
        Series glory eluded <span style="font-weight: bold;">&#8220;the 
        Hitman.&#8221;</span> His Yankees never played in the Fall Classic. 
        He <span style="font-weight: bold;">managed</span> the Dodgers from 
        2011 to 2015 and has managed the Marlins since 2016.
    </li>
	<li class="list_item">
        <span class="label">Derek Jeter</span> (1974&ndash;present; shortstop) 
        became the starting shortstop for the Yanks in 1996, winning the 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Rookie of the Year Award</span> and 
        helping New York capture its <span style="font-weight: bold;">first 
        championship since 1978</span>. More post-season highlights followed, 
        including three more titles (1998, 1999, 2000), the 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">2000 World Series MVP</span> award, 
        and a controversial homer against the Baltimore Orioles in Game One 
        of the 1996 ALCS when a twelve-year-old fan turned his fly ball into 
        a home run by <span style="font-weight: bold;">reaching over the 
        right-field wall</span> to catch it. His heroics in the 2001 World 
        Series, which was played later than usual due to 9/11, earned him 
        the nickname <span style="font-weight: bold;">&#8220;Mr. 
        November.&#8221; Jeter holds numerous Yankee records, including the 
        most hits and games played in franchise history. After his jersey 
        number (2) was retired in 2017, the Yankees had retired all 
        single-digit jersey numbers.</span>
    </li>
	<li class="list_item">
        <span class="label">Alex Rodriguez</span> (1975&ndash;present, 
        shortstop/third base) Nicknamed <span style="font-weight: bold;">
        &#8220;A-Rod,&#8221;</span> Alex Rodriguez began his career as a 
        phenom shortstop with the Seattle Mariners. After the 2000 season, 
        he signed the largest contract in baseball history and joined the 
        Texas Rangers; he was traded to the Yankees in 2004 and signed an 
        even more lucrative contract extension three years later. He 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">changed positions to third base
        </span> upon joining the Yankees due to Derek Jeter occupying the 
        former. While A-Rod eclipsed 3,100 hits, hit 696 home runs, and 
        recorded an MLB record <span style="font-weight: bold;">25 grand 
        slams</span>, his later career was marred by issues related to 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">performance-enhancing drugs</span>. 
        Due to his involvement in the <span style="font-weight: bold;">
        Biogenesis</span> scandal, he was <span style="font-weight: bold;">
        suspended for the entire 2014 season</span>. Rodriguez was part of 
        the Yankees&#8217; 2009 World Series-winning team.
    </li>
	<li class="list_item">
        <span class="label">Aaron Judge</span> (1992&ndash;present; right 
        field) Judge took MLB by storm upon his debut in 2017. He homered 
        in his first career at bat, won the year&#8217;s Home Run Derby, 
        and finished the season with 52 total home runs, a record for a 
        rookie player. Standing 6&nbsp;feet, 7&nbsp;inches tall, Judge 
        instantly became a fan favorite, adopting the nickname 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">&#8220;All Rise&#8221;</span> and 
        becoming the focus of a small section at Yankee Stadium where fans 
        wear judges&#8217; robes. Judge unusually wears the 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">jersey number 99</span>, which he 
        received in the minor leagues. A free swinger, he also set a record 
        in 2017 by <span style="font-weight: bold;">striking out in 37 
        straight games</span>.
    </li>
	<li class="list_item">
        <span class="label">Mariano Rivera</span> (1969&ndash;present, 
        closing pitcher) Born in Panama, Rivera spent his entire 17-year 
        career with the Yankees, spending much of it as the team&#8217;s 
        closer. He primarily made use of a highly effective 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">cutter</span>, a moving fastball 
        that broke an unusual amount of hitters bats. While he was a dominant 
        closer for his entire career, recording a 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">record 652 saves</span> and managing 
        an incredible <span style="font-weight: bold;">2.21 career ERA</span>, 
        he was even more dominant in the playoffs, where his ERA was a mere 
        0.70. He was the <span style="font-weight: bold;">first person to be 
        unanimously elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame</span>, reaching 
        Cooperstown in 2019. He was also the 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">final player in MLB history to 
        wear the number 42</span>, which was retired league-wide to honor 
        Jackie Robinson; players who wore the number at the time were 
        permitted to continue wearing it, and Rivera was the last such player 
        to retire.
