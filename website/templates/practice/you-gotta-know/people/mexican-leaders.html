        <span class="label">Montezuma&nbsp;II</span> (c.&nbsp;1466&ndash;1520) 
        was one of the last rulers of the <span style="font-weight: bold;">
        Aztec empire</span>. In 1519 Montezuma allowed armed forces led by 
        the Spanish <i style="font-weight: bold;">conquistador</i> 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Hern&aacute;n Cort&eacute;s</span> 
        to enter the Aztec capital, <span style="font-weight: bold;">
        Tenochtitl&aacute;n</span>. Several months later, the Spanish 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">imprisoned</span> Montezuma within 
        his own palace. After the conquistador 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Pedro de&nbsp;Alvarado</span> took 
        advantage of Montezuma&#8217;s captivity to 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">massacre peaceful celebrants at a 
        religious festival</span>, the Aztecs selected a new ruler named 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Cuitl&aacute;huac</span>, and the 
        city erupted into conflicts that led to Montezuma&#8217;s death. 
        The Spanish then fled during an escape that is called the 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">&#8220;Noche Triste,&#8221;</span> 
        or &#8220;Sad Night&#8221; because many conquistadors died while 
        crossing the causeways that connected the island city 
        Tenochtitl&aacute;n to the shores of 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Lake Texcoco</span>. By 1521, 
        the ravages of <span style="font-weight: bold;">smallpox</span> 
        and the help of indigenous <span style="font-weight: bold;">Tlaxcalan
        </span> allies allowed Cort&eacute;s to conquer Tenochtitl&aacute;n 
        and to capture <span style="font-weight: bold;">Cuauht&eacute;moc
        </span>, the final Aztec emperor.
    </li>
	<li class="list_item">
        <span class="label">Miguel Hidalgo</span> (1753&ndash;1811) was a 
        parish <span style="font-weight: bold;">priest</span> who became 
        the <span style="font-weight: bold;">leader of Mexico&#8217;s first 
        independence movement</span>. After <span style="font-weight: bold;">
        Napoleon invaded the Iberian Peninsula</span> in 1808 and ousted the 
        Spanish king Ferdinand&nbsp;VII, political movements advocating 
        Enlightenment ideas of <span style="font-weight: bold;">
        representative government</span> and <span style="font-weight: bold;">
        local self-determination</span> sprung up in many of Spain&#8217;s 
        American colonies. Hidalgo belonged to one such group, which 
        officials in the viceroyalty of <span style="font-weight: bold;">
        New Spain</span> attempted to suppress. In response, Hidalgo called 
        his congregation together and issued a call for 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">revolt</span> known as the 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">&#8220;Grito de Dolores,&#8221;
        </span> or &#8220;Cry of Dolores&#8221; on September&nbsp;16, 1810. 
        The rebels captured the cities <span style="font-weight: bold;">
        Guanajuato</span> and <span style="font-weight: bold;">Guadalajara
        </span>, but were <span style="font-weight: bold;">unable to take 
        Mexico City</span>. In 1811, Hidalgo was captured and 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">executed</span> by the 
        colonial regime. The leadership of the independence movement then 
        fell to another priest named <span style="font-weight: bold;">
        Jos&eacute; Mar&iacute;a Morelos</span>, who was himself executed 
        in 1815. Although Hidalgo&#8217;s movement was unsuccessful, 
        September&nbsp;16 is still celebrated as Mexico&#8217;s official 
        Day of Independence.

	<li class="list_item">
        <span class="label">Agust&iacute;n de&nbsp;Iturbide</span> 
        (1783&ndash;1824) was a <span style="font-weight: bold;">royalist 
        general</span> who changed his allegiances to become the 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">first ruler of independent 
        Mexico</span>. Like many <span style="font-weight: bold;">Creoles
        </span>, or people of European descent born in the Americas, Iturbide 
        feared that the insurgency would upset 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">colonial hierarchies of race and class
        </span>. In 1820, however, a <span style="font-weight: bold;">liberal 
        revolution in Spain</span> caused conservative Mexican elites to 
        reconsider the benefits of independence. Iturbide reached out to the 
        insurgent leader <span style="font-weight: bold;">Vicente Guerrero
        </span>, and agreed to endorse <span style="font-weight: bold;">
        legal racial equality</span> in exchange for Guerrero&#8217;s military 
        support. Early in 1821 Iturbide released the 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Plan of Iguala</span>, which is 
        also known as the &#8220;Plan of the Three Guarantees&#8221; or 
        &#8220;Plan Trigarante&#8221; because it called for 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Mexican independence</span>, a 
        wholly <span style="font-weight: bold;">Catholic state</span>, and 
        the <span style="font-weight: bold;">equality of all races</span>. 
        Iturbide&#8217;s Army of the Three Guarantees soon forced 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Juan O&#8217;Donoju</span>, the 
        last viceroy of New Spain, to acknowledge Mexican independence in 
        the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Treaty of C&oacute;rdoba
        </span>. In 1822 Iturbide became the 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">first emperor of Mexico</span>, 
        but a revolt led by <span style="font-weight: bold;">Antonio 
        L&oacute;pez de Santa Anna</span> forced Iturbide into 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">exile</span> in 1823. When 
        Iturbide returned to Mexico in 1824, he was quickly 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">executed</span>.
    </li>
	<li class="list_item">
        <span class="label">Antonio L&oacute;pez de Santa Anna</span> 
        (1794&ndash;1876) was a general who served as 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">president of Mexico eleven different 
        times</span> between 1833 and 1855. After gaining independence, many 
        Latin American nations fell under the rule of 
        <i style="font-weight: bold;">caudillos</i>, or charismatic leaders 
        who exercised both <span style="font-weight: bold;">military and 
        political power</span>. As one of these figures, Santa Anna cultivated 
        an image of himself as a <span style="font-weight: bold;">savior
        </span> of the Mexican nation, and even held an elaborate funeral 
        for the <span style="font-weight: bold;">leg that he lost during a 
        conflict with France</span> known as the 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">&#8220;Pastry War.&#8221;</span> 
        However, Santa Anna proved unable to prevent the loss of 
        Mexico&#8217;s northern territories. Despite routing the defenders 
        of the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Alamo</span>, Santa Anna 
        was defeated by the forces of Sam Houston at the 1836 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Battle of San Jacinto</span>, and 
        was forced to recognize <span style="font-weight: bold;">Texan 
        independence</span>. A little more than a decade later, Santa Anna 
        seized control of the government during the 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Mexican-American War</span>, 
        only to lose major battles at <span style="font-weight: bold;">
        Cerro Gordo</span> and <span style="font-weight: bold;">Chapultepec
        </span>, and be forced into <span style="font-weight: bold;">exile
        </span>. He returned to Mexico in 1853 and tried to establish a 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">permanent dictatorship</span>, 
        but was challenged by the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Liberal 
        Plan of Ayutla</span>, and was driven from power in 1855.
    </li>
	<li class="list_item">
        <span class="label">Benito Ju&aacute;rez</span> (1806&ndash;1872) 
        was a <span style="font-weight: bold;">Liberal</span> 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">lawyer</span> who became the 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">first indigenous president of 
        Mexico</span>, and who led the opposition to the French-backed 
        empire of <span style="font-weight: bold;">Maximilian 
        von&nbsp;Habsburg</span>. Born to a <span style="font-weight: bold;">
        Zapotec</span> family in the state of <span style="font-weight: bold;">
        Oaxaca</span>, Ju&aacute;rez became a key figure in the Liberal 
        movement that <span style="font-weight: bold;">deposed Santa Anna
        </span>, and which initiated legal and social changes known as 
        <i style="font-weight: bold;">La Reforma</i> (&#8220;the 
        Reform&#8221;). An 1855 law named after Ju&aacute;rez 
        sought to <span style="font-weight: bold;">eliminate special 
        privileges</span> given to members of the church and military, and 
        was incorporated into a <span style="font-weight: bold;">new 
        constitution</span> ratified in 1857. Conservative backlash soon led 
        to the <span style="font-weight: bold;">War of the Reform</span>, 
        which lasted from 1857 to 1861, and left the victorious Liberals 
        with little money in the national treasury. France&#8217;s emperor 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Napoleon&nbsp;III</span> then used 
        Mexico&#8217;s <span style="font-weight: bold;">foreign debts</span> 
        to as a pretext for an invasion known as the 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">&#8220;French Intervention,&#8221;
        </span> which briefly imposed the Austrian archduke 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Maximilian</span> as Mexico&#8217;s 
        second emperor. As the elected president of Mexico, Ju&aacute;rez 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">evaded capture</span> by French 
        and imperial troops while rallying Republican forces. After the 
        departure of the French, Liberal troops captured and 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">executed</span> Maximilian on the 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Hill of the Bells</span> in the city 
        of <span style="font-weight: bold;">Quer&eacute;taro</span>. 
        Ju&aacute;rez returned to Mexico City, and remained president until 
        his death.
    </li>
	<li class="list_item">
        <span class="label">Porfirio D&iacute;az</span> (1830&ndash;1915) was 
        a <span style="font-weight: bold;">Liberal</span> 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">general</span> who established a 
        long-lasting <span style="font-weight: bold;">dictatorship</span> 
        that eventually led to the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Mexican 
        Revolution</span>. In 1876 D&iacute;az issued the 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Plan of Tuxtepec</span> and seized 
        power from the Liberal president <span style="font-weight: bold;">
        Sebasti&aacute;n Lerdo de&nbsp;Tejada</span>. D&iacute;az then 
        dominated Mexican politics for the next 35&nbsp;years, and served 
        as president continuously between 1884 and 1911 despite his earlier 
        use of the slogan <span style="font-weight: bold;">&#8220;Effective 
        Suffrage and No Re-Election.&#8221;</span> While in office, 
        D&iacute;az skillfully <span style="font-weight: bold;">manipulated
        </span> federal, state, and local politics, 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">suppressed dissent</span>, tamed the 
        fractious <span style="font-weight: bold;">Mexican army</span>, 
        opened Mexico to <span style="font-weight: bold;">foreign investment
        </span>, and oversaw the beginnings of the country&#8217;s 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">industrial development</span>. His 
        supporters praised him as a brilliant statesman who had ended the 
        upheavals of the mid-nineteenth century; his detractors stressed the 
        inequality, corruption, and systematic brutality of the political 
        and economic systems fostered by D&iacute;az and his 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">positivist advisors</span>, who 
        were known as <span style="font-weight: bold;">Cient&iacute;ficos
        </span>. In 1908 D&iacute;az discussed the possibility of his 
        resignation during an interview with the American journalist 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">James Creelman</span>, which 
        helped open the door to <span style="font-weight: bold;">electoral 
        mobilization</span>, and eventually to 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">armed rebellion</span>. The 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Anti-Reelectionist</span> forces of 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Francisco Madero</span> revolted in 
        1910 and won their first victories in 1911, sparking uprisings 
        elsewhere in the country. D&iacute;az promptly resigned under terms 
        stipulated in the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Treaty of Ciudad 
        Ju&aacute;rez</span>, and spent the last years of his life in 
        comfortable <span style="font-weight: bold;">European exile</span>.
    </li>
	<li class="list_item">
        <span class="label">Francisco Madero</span> (1873&ndash;1913) led 
        the 1910 <span style="font-weight: bold;">revolution against 
        Porfirio D&iacute;az</span>, and served as president of Mexico from 
        1911 to 1913. As the <span style="font-weight: bold;">idealistic
        </span> son of a <span style="font-weight: bold;">wealthy Coahuilan
        </span> family, Madero was in some ways an unlikely revolutionary. 
        However, Madero&#8217;s idealism allowed him to challenge 
        D&iacute;az with a boldness that more powerful politicians and 
        generals had lacked. After the <span style="font-weight: bold;">
        Creelman interview</span> was released, Madero wrote a book titled 
        <i style="font-weight: bold;">The Presidential Succession in 1910</i>, 
        which argued that it was time for D&iacute;az to be replaced, and 
        which revived D&iacute;az&#8217;s former slogan, 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">&#8220;Effective Suffrage and No 
        Re-Election.&#8221;</span> Madero then ran for president, but was 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">arrested</span> before the election. 
        After <span style="font-weight: bold;">escaping from prison</span>, 
        Madero issued the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Plan of San Luis 
        Potos&iacute;</span>, which called for a 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">general revolt</span> in November 
        1910. Dissatisfaction with the D&iacute;az regime coalesced around 
        Madero, who unseated the dictator and took power after democratic 
        elections were held in the fall of 1911. However, Madero was unable 
        to satisfy the far-reaching demands of the diverse coalition that 
        had brought him to power. Madero was also disliked by the American 
        ambassador <span style="font-weight: bold;">Henry Lane Wilson</span> 
        and by former supporters of the D&iacute;az regime, many of whom 
        retained their positions in the government and army. In February 
        1913, Wilson encouraged General <span style="font-weight: bold;">
        Victoriano Huerta</span> to participate in a 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">coup</span> against Madero. After 
        a period of fighting within Mexico City that is known as the 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Decena Tr&aacute;gica</span>, or 
        Tragic Ten Days, Madero was forced to 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">resign</span>. Huerta became 
        president, and Madero was murdered a few days later.
    </li>
	<li class="list_item">
        <span class="label">Venustiano Carranza</span> (1859&ndash;1920) was 
        the <span style="font-weight: bold;">&#8220;First Chief&#8221; of 
        the Constitutionalist army</span> during the 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Mexican Revolution</span>, and 
        president of Mexico from 1917 to 1920. After the death of 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Francisco Madero</span>, Carranza 
        issued the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Plan of Guadalupe</span>, 
        and became the nucleus of opposition to 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Victoriano Huerta</span>&#8217;s 
        regime. Carranza&#8217;s movement was supported by the generals 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Pablo Gonz&aacute;lez</span>, 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">&Aacute;lvaro Obreg&oacute;n</span>, 
        and <span style="font-weight: bold;">Pancho Villa</span>, who 
        assembled armies in northern Mexico and pushed south to the capital. 
        The southern general <span style="font-weight: bold;">Emiliano Zapata
        </span> also allied with Carranza to remove Huerta from power. 
        After Huerta was forced to resign in 1914, members of Carranza&#8217;s 
        movement held a convention in the city of 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Aguascalientes</span>. The 
        convention formed a new government that was supported by Villa and 
        Zapata, but opposed by Gonz&aacute;lez and Obreg&oacute;n. 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Constitutionalist</span> and 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Convention</span> forces battled 
        until 1915, when Carranza&#8217;s adherents gained the upper hand 
        and the Convention split into separate factions, some of which 
        continued to fight the Constitutionalists for years. Carranza went 
        on to call for a <span style="font-weight: bold;">new constitution
        </span>, to be based on the Liberal Constitution of 1857. The 
        ensuing <span style="font-weight: bold;">Constitution of 1917</span> 
        went far beyond the minor reforms that Carranza had envisioned, and 
        promoted <span style="font-weight: bold;">land redistribution</span>, 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">workers&#8217; rights</span>, 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">anticlericalism</span>, and 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">national ownership of Mexico&#8217;s 
        natural resources</span>. Over the next several years, Carranza 
        proved reluctant to enact the 1917 constitution&#8217;s more radical 
        provisions, or to give up control of the government. Obreg&oacute;n 
        forced Carranza to <span style="font-weight: bold;">flee</span> the 
        capital in 1920, and likely had a role in Carranza&#8217;s subsequent 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">assassination</span>.</li>

        <span class="label">Emiliano Zapata</span> (1879&ndash;1919) class="label"ont-family: Cambria; font-weight: bold; 
        font-size: large;">Pancho Villa</span> (born Doroteo Arango) 
        (1878&ndash;1923) were both early supporters of 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Francisco Madero</span>, opponents of 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Victoriano Huerta</span>, and leaders 
        of the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Convention forces</span> 
        during the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Mexican Revolution</span>. 
        Villa chiefly operated in northern Mexico, while Zapata was based in 
        his home state, <span style="font-weight: bold;">Morelos</span>, south 
        of Mexico City. In 1911 Villa and <span style="font-weight: bold;">
        Pascual Orozco</span> led Maderista forces at the 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Battle of Ciudad Ju&aacute;rez
        </span>, while Zapata issued the <span style="font-weight: bold;">
        Plan of Ayala</span>, which called for the breakup of large 
        <i style="font-weight: bold;">haciendas</i> and the restoration of 
        communal lands known as <i style="font-weight: bold;">ejidos</i>. 
        During Madero&#8217;s presidency Villa was imprisoned by Victoriano 
        Huerta, who also conducted a brutal military campaign against the 
        peasant supporters of Zapata. After Madero&#8217;s death, Villa 
        joined Carranza&#8217;s army as the leader of the 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Divisi&oacute;n del Norte</span>, or 
        Division of the North, and Zapata established himself as the central 
        leader of the various <span style="font-weight: bold;">southern 
        guerrilla movements</span>. At the <span style="font-weight: bold;">
        Convention of Aguascalientes</span>, Villa&#8217;s supporters sought 
        to promote the rights of peasants and workers; 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Zapatistas</span> took a less active 
        role at the meeting, but were willing to support the Convention 
        government in opposition to Carranza. In the subsequent fighting, 
        Zapatista soldiers <span style="font-weight: bold;">took the capital
        </span> several times but were <span style="font-weight: bold;">
        unable to hold it</span> after 1915, the same year that Villa 
        suffered defeats at the <span style="font-weight: bold;">battles of 
        Celaya</span> and <span style="font-weight: bold;">Agua Prieta</span>. 
        Zapata retreated to Morelos and carried out local 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">land reforms</span> as the 
        Constitutionalists focused on defeating Villa, who sought to obtain 
        supplies by carrying out a 1916 <span style="font-weight: bold;">
        raid on the American town of Columbus, New Mexico</span>. In 
        response to this incursion, the U.S. sent a 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">&#8220;punitive expedition&#8221;
        </span> led by General <span style="font-weight: bold;">John J. 
        Pershing</span> to (unsuccessfully) pursue Villa across northern 
        Mexico. The influence of Villa and Zapata declined, and both were 
        eventually <span style="font-weight: bold;">assassinated</span>. 
        However, the two men remain symbols of the Revolution&#8217;s 
        popular aspirations. Zapata in particular has served as an 
        inspiration to later movements such as the Chiapas-based EZLN, 
        or <span style="font-weight: bold;">Zapatista Army of National 
        Liberation</span>.

        <span class="label">L&aacute;zaro C&aacute;rdenas</span> 
        (1895&ndash;1970) was a <span style="font-weight: bold;">revolutionary 
        general</span> who served as <span style="font-weight: bold;">
        president</span> from 1934 to 1940, and who worked to fulfill the 
        Constitution of 1917&#8217;s promises of 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">land reform</span> and 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">nationalization</span> of key 
        resources. After Carranza&#8217;s death, Mexico was ruled by the 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">&#8220;Sonoran dynasty&#8221;</span> 
        of <span style="font-weight: bold;">&Aacute;lvaro Obreg&oacute;n
        </span> and <span style="font-weight: bold;">Plutarco El&iacute;as 
        Calles</span>, who stabilized the country and implemented limited 
        reforms. Calles also founded a forerunner of the 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">PRI</span>, or Institutional Party 
        of the Revolution, which dominated Mexican politics throughout the 
        20th century. After stepping down as president, Calles continued to 
        control Mexican politics from 1928 to 1934 during a period known as 
        the <span style="font-weight: bold;">&#8220;Maximato.&#8221;</span> 
        However, C&aacute;rdenas surprised Calles by turning against him, and 
        forcing him into exile. As president, C&aacute;rdenas also 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">broke up large estates</span> into 
        communal <i style="font-weight: bold;">ejidos</i>, promoted 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">organized labor</span>, and 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">expropriated foreign-owned oil 
        fields</span> in 1938 to form the national oil company 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Pemex</span>, or Petr&oacute;leos 
        Mexicanos. These actions made C&aacute;rdenas very popular, but once 
        he left office the Mexican government&#8217;s commitment to economic 
        redistribution soon waned. In 1988 L&aacute;zaro&#8217;s son 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Cuauht&eacute;moc C&aacute;rdenas
        </span> challenged PRI control of politics by running for president 
        as the candidate of the <span style="font-weight: bold;">PRD</span>, 
        or Party of the Democratic Revolution. Although 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">electoral fraud</span> prevented 
        Cuauht&eacute;moc C&aacute;rdenas from winning, his challenge helped 
        to bring about political changes that eventually led 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Vicente Fox</span> of the 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">PAN</span>, or National Action 
        Party, to be elected president in 2000.
