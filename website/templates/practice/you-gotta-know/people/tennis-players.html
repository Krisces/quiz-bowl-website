<h3 style="font-family: Cambria; font-weight: bold;">Men</h3>
<ul class="list2">
    <li class="list_item">
        <span class="label">Pete Sampras</span> (1971&ndash;present). 
        &#8220;Pistol Pete&#8221; burst onto the scene in 1990, when he 
        became the <span style="font-weight: bold;">youngest man ever to 
        win the U.S. Open</span>. He would take five U.S. Opens and two 
        Australian Opens, but his greatest accomplishments came on the 
        Wimbledon grass. Starting in 1993 he <span style="font-weight: bold;">
        won Wimbledon seven times in eight years</span>, losing only to 
        Richard Krajicek in the quarterfinals in 1996. The last Wimbledon 
        win (2000) gave Sampras the all-time men&#8217;s major record, 
        passing Roy Emerson&#8217;s 12. Married to actress Bridgette 
        Wilson, Sampras silenced his critics (who thought he was washed 
        up) by defeating Andre Agassi for the 2002 U.S. Open title &mdash; 
        then he retired.
    </li>
	<li class="list_item">
        <span class="label">Bjorn Borg</span> (1956&ndash;present). On both 
        grass and clay in the late 1970s, resistance to Borg was futile; he 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">won Wimbledon five straight years
        </span> (1976&ndash;80) and the <span style="font-weight: bold;">
        French Open six times</span>, for a total of 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">11 majors</span>. Borg got 
        started at age nine, after his father won a tennis racket in a 
        ping-pong tournament and gave it to him. He took his first French 
        in 1974 and dominated through 1981, when John McEnroe finally 
        knocked him off at Wimbledon. Borg then inexplicably retired at 26; 
        he tried an unsuccessful comeback in the early 1990s. Despite his 
        great success, Borg never won the U.S. Open (reaching the final 
        four times). He played at the Australian Open only once, usually 
        preferring to take the winter months off.
    </li>
	<li class="list_item">
        <span class="label">Andre Agassi</span> (1970&ndash;present). His 
        father boxed for Iran in the 1948 and 1952 Olympics; his own Olympic 
        exploits included the 1996 tennis gold. Born in Las Vegas, he 
        reached the world&#8217;s #3 ranking at age 18 but was better 
        known for his image than for his play. Perhaps the greatest 
        returner and baseline player ever, Agassi won his first major on 
        Wimbledon grass in 1992. Briefly married to Brooke Shields, he 
        fell to #141 in the world in 1997, but after they divorced, Agassi 
        rededicated himself to the game. In 1999 he won the French Open, 
        becoming just the <span style="font-weight: bold;">fifth man to 
        complete the career Grand Slam</span>. In all, Agassi has won 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">eight major singles titles</span> 
        (five since 1999), and is now married to women&#8217;s great 
        Steffi Graf.
    </li>
	<li class="list_item">
        <span class="label">John McEnroe</span> (1959&ndash;present). 
        Though perhaps best known for his <span style="font-weight: bold;">
        fiery temper</span> and <span style="font-weight: bold;">abuse 
        of referees</span> (with taunts like &#8220;You can&#8217;t be 
        serious!&#8221;), McEnroe was the dominant player of the early 
        1980s. As a 17-year old amateur qualifier, he made the semifinals 
        of Wimbledon, and in 1979 he won the first of 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">three straight U.S. Opens</span>. 
        He almost ended Borg&#8217;s run of Wimbledons in a five-set 
        thriller in 1980, but succeeded the following year. In 1984, 
        McEnroe compiled an 82&ndash;3 record, winning Wimbledon and his 
        fourth U.S. Open, for a total of seven majors. An outstanding 
        doubles player as well, he won 77 titles, many with partner 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Peter Fleming</span>. He also played 
        in the Davis Cup 12 times, captaining the U.S. team in 2000.
    </li>
	<li class="list_item">
        <span class="label">Arthur Ashe</span> (1943&ndash;1993). Ashe once 
        claimed that he would consider himself a failure if he were 
        remembered only for tennis. The <span style="font-weight: bold;">
        first black man to win either the U.S. Championship (1968) or 
        Wimbledon (1975)</span>, he was also the 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">first American tennis player to 
        earn over $100,000 in one year</span> (1970). The author of <i>
        Hard Road to Glory</i>, a history of black athletes, Ashe 
        announced in 1992 that tainted blood from a 1983 heart surgery 
        had given him the AIDS virus. Arthur Ashe Stadium, the current 
        home of the U.S. Open, was named for him in 1997.
    </li>
	<li class="list_item">
        <span class="label">Roger Federer</span> (1981&ndash;present) Swiss 
        superstar Roger Federer became the number-one player in the world 
        in February 2004 and held that spot until he was eclipsed by 
        Rafael Nadal in August 2008, a full 237 weeks later. He was 21 
        when he earned his first of <span style="font-weight: bold;">eight 
        Wimbledon championships</span> in 2003, and he stayed dominant for 
        nearly 15 years, earning his 20th major title at the 2018 
        Australian Open. At the 2008 Olympics, Federer earned a gold medal 
        in men&#8217;s doubles with fellow Swiss star 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Stan Wawrinka</span>. In 2017, 
        he founded the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Laver Cup</span>, 
        a team event that pits European players against the rest of the world.
    </li>
	<li class="list_item">
        <span class="label">Rafael Nadal</span> (1986&ndash;present) Like 
        his long-time rival Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal has won a total of 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">20 majors</span>. Known as the 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">greatest clay court player</span> 
         history, Nadal earned 13 of his major wins at the French Open at 
         Roland-Garros. He is considered part of the 
         <span style="font-weight: bold;">&#8220;Big Four&#8220;</span> of 
         21st-century tennis players (with Federer, Novak Djokovic, and 
         Andy Murray), and is the only <span style="font-weight: bold;">
        left-handed</span> player among them. Nadal and Andre Agassi are 
        the only two singles players to win each of the four Grand Slam 
        tournaments and an Olympic gold medal, which Nadal won in 2008. 
        Nadal is from Mallorca in the Balearic Islands.
    </li>
	<li class="list_item">
        <span class="label">Novak Djokovic</span> (1987&ndash;present) The 
        Serbian-born Djokovic has made more money playing than any other 
        player in history, over $145&nbsp;million. In 2015, he reached the 
        finals of 15 straight tournaments in which he entered, and won 
        three of the four Grand Slam events. After winning the French Open 
        in 2016, Djokovic became the third man ever to hold 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">all four Grand Slam titles at 
        once</span>. At the 2020 U.S.&nbsp;Open, Djokovic was 
        controversially disqualified after a ball he hit accidentally 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">hit a line judge</span> in the 
        throat; he had been the top seed of the tournament and was the 
        first top seed to receive a disqualification at a major event. As 
        of 2020, he is coached by Croatian tennis legend 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Goran Ivani&scaron;evic</span>.
    </li>
</ul>
<h3 style="font-family: Cambria; font-weight: bold;">Women</h3>
<ul class="list2">
    <li class="list_item">
        <span class="label">Martina Navratilova</span> (1956&ndash;present). 
        Born in Prague, she defected to the United States in 1975 because 
        the Czech Tennis Federation had taken most of her earnings. A bit 
        heavy early in her career, Navratilova won the first two of her 
        nine Wimbledons in 1978&ndash;79 but subsequent losses led her 
        to pursue a grueling fitness regimen. This paid off: She won 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">18 singles Grand Slams</span> 
        (58 overall), <span style="font-weight: bold;">167 total singles 
        titles</span>, and even more doubles crowns, many with partner 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Pam Shriver</span>. A Wimbledon 
        finalist at 37, Navratilova retired from singles in 1994, but 
        returned to play doubles in 2000. In 2003 she tied Billie Jean 
        King with <span style="font-weight: bold;">20 overall Wimbledons
        </span>, taking the mixed doubles at age 46.
    </li>
	<li class="list_item">
        <span class="label">Steffi Graf</span> (1969&ndash;present). Her 
        most devastating shot earned her the moniker &#8220;Fraulein 
        Forehand.&#8221; Graf turned pro at age 13 and steadily rose 
        through the rankings, garnering the #1 ranking and her first major 
        (French) in 1987. The following year, Graf made history by 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">winning the Grand Slam</span> 
        and the <span style="font-weight: bold;">gold medal at the Seoul 
        Olympics</span>, the <span style="font-weight: bold;">only 
        player ever to go 5-for-5 in one year</span>. 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Seven Wimbledons, six French, 
        five U.S., and four Australians add up to 22 major career singles 
        crowns</span> &mdash; the last coming at the French in 1999 after 
        two years of major back injuries. Graf retired that fall, and is 
        now raising her son Jaden with her husband Andre Agassi.
    </li>
	<li class="list_item">
        <span class="label">Chris Evert</span> (1954&ndash;present). Queen 
        of the Clay Courts, she <span style="font-weight: bold;">won the 
        French Open a record seven times</span> and rolled off a 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">125-match win streak</span> on 
        the surface. As a 15-year old, Evert upset Margaret Court, who had 
        just won the Grand Slam. 1974 was the first of a record 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">13 straight years in which she won 
        a major</span> &mdash; several of them hard-fought against her 
        rival, Martina Navratilova. In all, Evert took 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">18 Grand Slam singles titles
        </span>, and was the <span style="font-weight: bold;">first 
        female player to win $1&nbsp;million</span> in her career. She was 
        married to British tennis player John Lloyd for eight years, but 
        they divorced in 1987, and she then wed Olympic skier Andy Mill.
    </li>
	<li class="list_item">
        <span class="label">Billie Jean King</span> (1943&ndash;present). 
        Her records themselves are impressive: 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">12 Grand Slam singles wins
        </span> (including six Wimbledons) and 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">20 overall Wimbledon titles
        </span>. King, however, is best known for advancing women&#8217;s 
        athletics. Her brother, Randy Moffitt, pitched for the San 
        Francisco Giants; she herself reached a #4 world ranking in 1960 
        and turned pro eight years later. At the time, prize money for 
        women was paltry, so she <span style="font-weight: bold;">
        co-founded the Virginia Slims Tour</span>, and in 1971 became the 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">first female athlete to earn 
        $100,000 in a year</span>. Two years later, in front of over 
        30,000 at the Astrodome, she <span style="font-weight: bold;">
        whipped Bobby Riggs in the &#8220;Battle of the Sexes.&#8221;
        </span> King retired in 1983, but not before winning a singles 
        tournament at age 39.
    </li>
	<li class="list_item">
        <span class="label">Margaret Smith Court</span> (1942&ndash;present). 
        The <span style="font-weight: bold;">most prolific winner, male or 
        female</span>, she amassed <span style="font-weight: bold;">62 
        Grand Slam titles</span>, 24 of them in singles (3 Wimbledon, 5 
        French, 5 U.S., and 11 in her native Australia). Billie Jean King 
        called Court &#8220;The Arm&#8221; because of her long reach, 
        aided by her height of nearly six feet. In 1970 she became the 
        second woman (after Maureen Connolly) to win the Grand Slam, taking 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">21 singles championships</span> 
        overall that year; less impressive was her 1973 loss to 55-year 
        old Bobby Riggs. Court did defeat King, Riggs&#8217;s nemesis, 22 
        of 32 times. She retired in 1977 and became a lay minister.
    </li>
	<li class="list_item">
        <span class="label">Venus and Serena Williams</span> 
        (1980&ndash;present and 1981&ndash;present). Althea Gibson and 
        Arthur Ashe may have preceded them as trailblazing African-American 
        players, but the sisters have taken the game to new levels and to 
        more people. Born in Compton, California and coached from an early 
        age by father Richard, Venus broke through first, reaching the 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">final of the U.S. Open</span> in 
        1997. Serena won a <span style="font-weight: bold;">Grand Slam
        </span> before Venus did (1999 U.S. Open), but Venus hit #1 by 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">sweeping Wimbledon and the U.S. 
        Opens in both 2000 and 2001</span>. For a long time Serena could 
        not beat her older sister, but that changed in 2002, when she took 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">four straight major finals</span> 
        against Venus. With her 2003 win at Wimbledon, Serena now has six 
        majors to Venus&#8217;s four. On the side, both are fashion 
        designers, while Venus also designs interiors.
    </li>
	<li class="list_item">
        <span class="label">Naomi Osaka</span> (1997&ndash;present) Just weeks 
        before turning 21, Osaka bested Serena Williams to win the 2018 
        U.S.&nbsp;Open. Months later, she won her second major in as many 
        tries at the 2019 Australian Open. Osaka is the 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">first Japanese-born player to win 
        any Grand Slam title</span>. As of 2020, she is the 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">highest-paid female athlete in 
        the world</span>, with annual earnings of over 
        $37&nbsp;million&mdash;the highest single-year total of any female 
        athlete ever, easily beating a record once held by fellow tennis 
        star Maria Sharapova. She has Japanese and Haitian ancestry.
