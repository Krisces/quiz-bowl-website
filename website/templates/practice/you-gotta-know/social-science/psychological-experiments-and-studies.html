        <span class="label">Ivan Pavlov&#8217;s classical conditioning 
        experiments</span> (1901) were among the first to study the ways in 
        which unrelated <span style="font-weight: bold;">unconditioned and 
        neutral stimuli</span> could be linked together through repetition 
        to produce a <span style="font-weight: bold;">conditioned response
        </span>. Pavlov, who studied the <span style="font-weight: bold;">
        digestive tracts of dogs</span> (work that won him the 1904 Nobel 
        Prize in Physiology or Medicine), noticed that his canine subjects 
        began to <span style="font-weight: bold;">salivate</span> as soon 
        as they saw the lab assistant who normally fed them, which he called 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">&#8220;psychic secretion.&#8221;
        </span> Pavlov designed an experiment in which dogs heard the sound 
        of a <span style="font-weight: bold;">metronome</span> (commonly 
        misidentified as a <span style="font-weight: bold;">bell</span>) and 
        were then presented with food. With repetition, the neutral stimulus 
        of the metronome became linked to the unconditioned stimulus of 
        food and the unconditioned response of salivation to produce the 
        conditioned response of salivating at the sound of the metronome.

        <span class="label">The Little Albert experiment</span> (1920) was 
        carried out by psychologist <span style="font-weight: bold;">John 
        Watson</span>, with assistance from <span style="font-weight: bold;">
        Rosalie Rayner</span>, to test if it was possible to intentionally 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">condition fear</span> in an 
        otherwise normal child. Watson initially exposed an infant test 
        subject (identified by the pseudonym &#8220;Albert&#8221;) to 
        numerous white, fluffy stimuli, such as a rat, a rabbit, and wool; 
        the infant displayed no fear of these items. Watson then began to 
        expose the infant to a <span style="font-weight: bold;">white rat
        </span>, while banging a bar with a hammer to create a loud, scary 
        noise whenever the infant interacted with the rat. Eventually, 
        Albert began to react with distress when exposed to any white 
        fluffy stimuli, including a <span style="font-weight: bold;">Santa 
        Claus mask</span>. The experiment has been heavily criticized on 
        both ethical grounds (for the infliction of trauma on an infant) 
        and on procedural grounds (as one child identified as potentially 
        being &#8220;Little Albert&#8221; may have been born with serious 
        cognitive impairment).

    <li class="list_item">
        <span class="label">The Skinner box</span> (first used ca.&nbsp;1930) 
        was an apparatus developed by psychologist 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">B.&nbsp;F. Skinner</span> during 
        his time as a graduate student at Harvard to explore the effects of 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">operant conditioning</span>, in 
        which a behavior may be increased or decreased through the use of 
        reinforcement or punishment, respectively. The design of the 
        Skinner box is similar to the <span style="font-weight: bold;">
        puzzle box</span> developed earlier by 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Edward Thorndike</span>. The most 
        basic Skinner box consists of a small chamber, into which an animal 
        is introduced, and a lever (or button, or other apparatus), which 
        Skinner called a <span style="font-weight: bold;">
        &#8220;manipulandum.&#8221;</span> The manipulandum can deliver 
        food, turn off an electrified floor, or in some other way affect 
        the environment inside the box positively or negatively. The 
        animal&#8217;s interaction with the lever allows researchers to 
        observe changes in behavior in response to repeated reinforcements 
        or punishments.

        <span class="label">The Clark doll experiment</span> (1940) studied 
        the <span style="font-weight: bold;">perception of race in children
        </span>. Mamie Phipps Clark and Kenneth Clark were a married team 
        of psychologists and the first African Americans to receive 
        doctorates in psychology at Columbia University. In a series of 
        studies, they presented children across the country&mdash;from all 
        races&mdash;with dolls that were identical except for skin color 
        and hairstyle. They then asked the children to identify the 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">&#8220;nice doll,&#8221;</span> 
        the <span style="font-weight: bold;">&#8220;bad doll,&#8221;</span> 
        and other questions involving subjective judgments. The results of 
        the study indicated that children of all races showed a 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">preference for the white doll
        </span>, indicating that racism in American society created an 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">inherent sense of inferiority
        </span> in Black children even by the age of five. The 
        Clark&#8217;s research was cited by the Supreme Court in its 
        decision in <i>Brown v. Board of Education</i> ordering the 
        desegregation of schools.

        <span class="label">The first Asch conformity experiment</span> 
        (1951) was designed and run by <span style="font-weight: bold;">
        Solomon Asch</span> at Swarthmore College in an attempt to see 
        whether individuals would conform to the thinking of a group of 
        peers in a situation in which the group was clearly wrong. 
        Participants in the experiment were paired with seven other 
        people&mdash;all of whom were in on the plan. The groups were shown 
        a <span style="font-weight: bold;">&#8220;base&#8221; line</span>, 
        then were shown three other lines, and were asked to pick which of 
        the three other lines was the <span style="font-weight: bold;">same 
        length</span> as the &#8220;base&#8221; line. On pre-planned trials, 
        the seven confederates each intentionally picked a line that was 
        clearly a different length than the &#8220;base&#8221; line. In 
        nearly 40&nbsp;percent of these trials, the subject of the experiment 
        also gave an incorrect answer, likely to conform with the answer 
        provided by the others.

    <li class="list_item">
        <span class="label">The Milgram obedience experiment</span> (1961) 
        (often just called the &#8220;Milgram experiment&#8221;) was carried 
        out at Yale University by psychologist 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Stanley Milgram</span>. Milgram was 
        inspired to conduct the experiment by the high-profile trial of 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Adolf Eichmann</span>, who claimed 
        the Nazis carrying out the Holocaust did it because they were merely 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">&#8220;following orders.&#8221;
        </span> In Milgram&#8217;s experiment, the subject was led to believe 
        they were administering <span style="font-weight: bold;">electric 
        shocks</span> to a <span style="font-weight: bold;">
        &#8220;learner&#8221;</span> (who was assisting in running the 
        experiment) to punish the learner for making mistakes. Subjects were 
        ordered to increase the voltage to dangerously high levels as the 
        experiment continued, as the learner <span style="font-weight: bold;">
        screamed in pain</span> and pleaded with them to stop; if they 
        stopped to question whether the experiment was safe, they were told 
        to continue. Over 60&nbsp;percent of participants eventually 
        administered shocks so powerful that they 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">would have killed the learner</span> 
        had they been real.
    </li>
    <li class="list_item">
        <span class="label">The Bobo doll experiment</span> (1961) was carried 
        out by <span style="font-weight: bold;">Albert Bandura</span> at 
        Stanford University, who wanted to study the effect of watching an 
        adult model on the behavior of children. Children in the experiment 
        observed an adult interacting with a &#8220;Bobo doll,&#8221; a large 
        self-righting toy designed to look like a clown. In some cases, the 
        adult completely ignored the doll; in other cases, the adult was 
        highly <span style="font-weight: bold;">aggressive</span> toward the 
        doll, to the extent of throwing it, hitting it with a mallet, and 
        yelling at it. Bandura found that children who observed an adult 
        acting aggressively toward the doll were far more likely to act 
        aggressively towards the doll themselves, as compared to children who 
        watched a model ignoring the doll. The experiment provided support for 
        the idea of <span style="font-weight: bold;">social learning theory
        </span>, which holds that behaviors may be learned by observing 
        models.

    <li class="list_item">
        <span class="label">The original Small-World experiment</span> 
        (1966&ndash;1967) was carried out by <span style="font-weight: bold;">
        Stanley Milgram</span> (who also carried out the obedience experiment) 
        to examine the interconnectedness of Americans. Milgram mailed a 
        number of people in <span style="font-weight: bold;">Nebraska</span> 
        and <span style="font-weight: bold;">Kansas</span> a package, and 
        asked them to <span style="font-weight: bold;">send it to a target in 
        Boston</span>. If they knew the individual in Boston, they could send 
        it directly to the target; if they did not, they were instructed to 
        send it to a personal acquaintance who they believed would be most 
        likely to know the person in Boston. This process continued until the 
        package reached the final person in Boston. The experiment showed 
        that, of the packages that did make their way to Boston, they 
        typically did so in five or six steps, leading to the coining of the 
        phrase <span style="font-weight: bold;">&#8220;six degrees of 
        separation.&#8221;</span> The experiment was an important early study 
        of <span style="font-weight: bold;">social networks</span>.

    <li class="list_item">
        <span class="label">Martin Seligman&#8217;s learned helplessness 
        experiments</span> (1967) were instrumental in identifying that 
        individuals who believe they are <span style="font-weight: bold;">
        powerless</span> to stop a harmful stimulus will eventually stop 
        trying to avoid it at all. Seligman divided a number of dogs into 
        three groups: one group which received no electric shocks, one 
        group that received electric shocks but could stop them by pressing 
        a lever, and one group which was led to believe they had 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">no control</span> over when the 
        shocks stopped or started. Each group of dogs was then placed into 
        a new situation where they were given shocks but presented an easy 
        means of escape. While the first two groups of dogs each quickly 
        escaped from the shocks, the third group&mdash;those given no 
        control over the initial shocks&mdash;made 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">no attempt at escape</span>. The 
        experiment had major implications for the understanding and 
        treatment of <span style="font-weight: bold;">clinical depression
        </span> via therapy.

        <span class="label">The Stanford prison experiment</span> (1971) was 
        designed by <span style="font-weight: bold;">Philip Zimbardo</span> 
        to study the effects of <span style="font-weight: bold;">power 
        dynamics</span> in custodial situations. Participants&mdash;college 
        students at Stanford University&mdash;were randomly assigned to be 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">&#8220;guards&#8221;</span> or 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">&#8220;prisoners&#8221;</span> for 
        a two-week period; the guards were instructed to refer to the 
        prisoners only by their <span style="font-weight: bold;">number
        </span>, not their name. Although the experience was designed to be 
        structured, by the second day prisoners had begun to rebel against 
        the guards, and guards (including one nicknamed 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">&#8220;John Wayne&#8221;</span>) 
        began to implement sadistic practices designed to degrade, humiliate, 
        and dehumanize inmates. The experiment was stopped after only six 
        days when <span style="font-weight: bold;">Christina Maslach</span>, 
        a psychology graduate student, raised <span style="font-weight: bold;">
        ethical objections</span>. Zimbardo later analyzed the experiment in a 
        book which compared the events of the Stanford prison to the abuses at 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Abu Ghraib</span>. Many aspects of 
        the experiment and its legitimacy have been questioned or disputed by 
        contemporary researchers and experiment participants.
