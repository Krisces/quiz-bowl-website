        <span class="label">The Queen of Spades</span> (1834) by 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Alexander Pushkin</span>. The 
        story begins at a late-night gambling party given by the Russian 
        army officer <span style="font-weight: bold;">Naroumov</span>. 
        There, <span style="font-weight: bold;">Tomsky</span> discusses 
        his own grandmother, a countess who once lost a fortune paying 
        the card game <span style="font-weight: bold;">faro</span> in 
        Paris, and who subsequently sought assistance from the 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Comte de Saint-Germain</span> 
        (a real historical figure). Saint-Germain taught the countess 
        how to win back her money by playing a sequence of three cards. 
        After hearing this tale, an engineering officer of German descent 
        named <span style="font-weight: bold;">Herman</span> schemes to 
        meet the countess by courting her ward 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Lizaveta</span>, who tells Herman 
        how to secretly enter the house. Herman accosts the countess, who 
        refuses to reveal the names of the cards. When Herman draws a 
        pistol, the countess dies of fright. At the countess&#8217;s 
        funeral, her corpse appears to wink at Herman. That night, Herman 
        is visited by the countess&#8217;s ghost, who tells him that the 
        cards are the <span style="font-weight: bold;">three, seven, and 
        ace</span>. Herman goes to the gambling salon of 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Chekalinsky</span>, where he wins 
        a massive sum of money by betting on the three. The following night, 
        Herman wins again by betting on the seven. On the third night he 
        intends to bet everything on the ace, but the card that he 
        actually plays is the <span style="font-weight: bold;">queen of 
        spades</span>. When Herman looks at the card, it seems to 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">wink</span> at him as the countess 
        had done. Herman goes insane and is put in an 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">asylum</span>, where he spends his 
        days muttering &#8220;three seven ace! Three seven queen!&#8221;

        <span class="label">Nevsky Prospekt</span> (1835) by 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Nikolai Gogol</span>. Nevsky 
        Prospekt is a major thoroughfare in <span style="font-weight: bold;">
        Saint Petersburg</span>. After describing the various types of 
        people who walk down the street at different times of day, the story 
        focuses on two men, who each pursue a beautiful woman. The first is 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Piskaryov</span>, a painter who 
        sees a <span style="font-weight: bold;">dark-haired woman</span>, 
        follows her to the brothel where she works, and falls obsessively 
        in love with her, eventually turning to 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">opium</span> to calm himself. He 
        returns and proposes to the woman, but she mocks his advances, 
        after which Piskaryov cuts his own throat. The second man, 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Lieutenant Pirogov</span>, follows 
        a <span style="font-weight: bold;">blond woman</span>. She turns out 
        to be the wife of a <span style="font-weight: bold;">German tinsmith
        </span>, who beats Pirogov. The lieutenant plans to avenge himself, 
        but abandons the idea after eating pastries and going dancing.

	<li class="list_item">
        <span class="label">The Nose</span> (1836) by 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Nikolai Gogol</span>. On the 
        morning of March&nbsp;25, the barber Yakovlevich cuts open a loaf 
        of bread, and discovers a nose inside it. The nose belongs to 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Major Kovalyov</span>, who wakes 
        up the same day to find a smooth patch of skin where his nose used 
        to be. Upon encountering his missing nose, which is traveling in a 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">carriage</span> and wearing the 
        uniform of a <span style="font-weight: bold;">state councillor
        </span>, Kovalyov chases it to a shopping center called the Gostiny 
        Dvor. There, Kovalyov wonders how to approach the nose, since its 
        uniform indicates that it has a higher status than him. Summoning 
        his courage, Kovalyov tries to convince the nose to return to his 
        face, but the nose claims not to recognize him. Kovalyov goes to 
        a newspaper, intending to offer a reward for the nose&#8217;s 
        return, but the clerk refuses his absurd-sounding request. Kovalyov 
        then speaks with the police, who later catch the nose attempting to 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">flee to Riga</span>. However, the 
        doctor that Kovalyov consults is unable to re-attach the nose, even 
        with an operation. Kovalyov writes a letter to 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Madame Alexandra Podtochina 
        Grigorievna</span>, accusing her of cursing him so that he will 
        marry her daughter, but receives an uncomprehending reply. Finally, 
        on April&nbsp;7, Kovalyov wakes up with his nose reattached, and 
        resumes his normal life.

        <span class="label">The Overcoat</span> (1842) by 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Nikolai Gogol</span>. Remarking on 
        the story&#8217;s importance to Russian literature, 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Fyodor Dostoyevsky</span> quipped 
        &#8220;we all come out of Gogol&#8217;s overcoat.&#8221; 
        The story&#8217;s protagonist is <span style="font-weight: bold;">
        Akaky Akakievich</span>, a poor government clerk whose only joy in 
        life is copying documents. His coworkers often make fun of his 
        worn-out overcoat, so he visits his tailor 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Petrovich</span>, who says that 
        the coat must be replaced. Akaky scrimps to save up the necessary 
        80&nbsp;roubles, and finally acquires the coat after receiving an 
        unexpectedly large bonus. As he walks home from a party that was 
        given in part to honor the new garment, Akaky is accosted by two 
        ruffians who <span style="font-weight: bold;">steal his overcoat
        </span>. Akaky tries to seek justice from the municipal 
        superintendent and from an <span style="font-weight: bold;">
        &#8220;important personage,&#8221;</span> but both refuse to help 
        him. Soon afterwards, Akaky contracts a fever and dies. His 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">ghost</span> is said to haunt the 
        streets of Saint Petersburg, searching for the stolen cloak. 
        Eventually, the &#8220;important personage&#8221; is accosted by 
        a figure whom he believes to be Akaky&#8217;s ghost, and is 
        forced to surrender his own coat. However, the story&#8217;s final 
        words hint that the supposed &#8220;ghost&#8221; was actually an 
        ordinary robber.

	<li class="list_item">
        <span class="label">The Death of Ivan Ilyich</span> (1886) by 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Leo Tolstoy</span>. The story 
        begins in a courtroom, as the death of the middle-aged magistrate 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Ivan Ilyich</span> prompts other 
        members of the legal profession to think about how the new vacancy 
        will affect their status. The story then describes Ivan&#8217;s 
        unhappy marriage to <span style="font-weight: bold;">Praskovya 
        Fedorovna</span>, and his move to Saint Petersburg. As he decorates 
        his new house, Ivan has an accident while demonstrating how he 
        wishes the <span style="font-weight: bold;">curtains</span> to be 
        hung. The accident slowly causes Ivan to suffer increasing pain, 
        during which he becomes dependant on the peasant servant 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Gerasim</span>, and contemplates 
        how meaningless his existence has been. At the end of his life, 
        Ivan <span style="font-weight: bold;">screams</span> continuously 
        for three days. Finally, Ivan sees light all around him at the 
        same time that his son <span style="font-weight: bold;">Vasya
        </span> kisses his hand, and realizes that all he can do to end 
        his family&#8217;s suffering is to die. Ivan thus 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">dies happily</span>.

	<li class="list_item">
        <span class="label">How Much Land Does a Man Need?</span> (1886) 
        by <span style="font-weight: bold;">Leo Tolstoy</span>. At the 
        start of the story, a peasant named <span style="font-weight: bold;">
        Pahom</span> listens to his wife and sister-in-law debate whether 
        it is better to live in the town or the country. Pahom thinks 
        &#8220;if I had plenty of land, I wouldn&#8217;t fear the Devil 
        himself!&#8221;&mdash;which the <span style="font-weight: bold;">
        Devil</span> hears from behind the stove. Shortly thereafter, 
        Pahom purchases land from a village woman. He becomes exceedingly 
        jealous and protective of his property, causing him to quarrel 
        with his neighbors and the local judges. Learning of rich land 
        elsewhere, Pahom moves his family, but still is not satisfied. 
        Desirous of acquiring even more land, Pahom visits the 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">nomadic Bashkirs</span>. Their 
        chief, who is possibly the Devil in disguise, says that one 
        thousand roubles will buy as much land as Pahom can walk around 
        in a single day. However, if Pahom does not return to his 
        starting point by sunset, both the money and the land are forfeit. 
        In his greed, Pahom ventures too far. He sprints back while the 
        chief laughs, just as the Devil did in one of Pahom&#8217;s 
        dreams. Pahom returns to the starting point just in time, but 
        immediately drops <span style="font-weight: bold;">dead from 
        exhaustion</span>. A servant buries Pahom in a 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">grave</span> that is six feet 
        long, thus answering the story&#8217;s title question: a man only 
        needs <span style="font-weight: bold;">six feet</span> of land.

	<li class="list_item">
        <span class="label">The Kreutzer Sonata</span> (1889) by 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Leo Tolstoy</span>. Both Russia 
        and the U.S. censored this novella, which describes the fatal 
        results of an <span style="font-weight: bold;">affair</span>. 
        As passengers on a train discuss marriage and love, a 
        &#8220;nervous man&#8221; named <span style="font-weight: bold;">
        Basile Posdnicheff</span> breaks into the conversation, and 
        insists that romantic love cannot endure for a lifetime. 
        Posdnicheff recalls the dissipations of his bachelor days 
        before explaining how he courted his wife, whom he accuses of 
        trapping him into marriage with her physical charms. According 
        to Posdnicheff, the idleness of the well-fed upper classes 
        leads to an unhealthy emphasis on romance, giving women power 
        over men. He advocates the ideal of <span style="font-weight: bold;">
        celibacy even in marriage</span>, astonishing the other train 
        passengers. Posdnicheff describes quarrels with his wife, 
        complaining that she was overly concerned with the health of 
        their children, and that she eventually used 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">contraception</span>. As the 
        marriage grows intolerable, Posdnifcheff&#8217;s wife spends 
        more time playing the <span style="font-weight: bold;">piano
        </span>, and is introduced by Posdnicheff to 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Troukhatchevsky</span>, who 
        studied the <span style="font-weight: bold;">violin</span> in Paris. 
        Although Posdnicheff is initially suspicious of Troukhatchevsky, 
        he is comforted by his wife&#8217;s disavowal of interest in the 
        musician, and by the elevated emotions he feels while listening 
        to his wife and Troukhatchevsky play 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Beethoven&#8217;s Kreutzer 
        Sonata</span>. However, Posdnicheff&#8217;s jealousy returns 
        during a work trip, when he receives a letter from his wife 
        mentioning Troukhatchevsky. He takes a long journey back to his 
        house, where he finds Troukhatchevsky&#8217;s overcoat. 
        Posdnicheff removes his shoes to walk more quietly, takes a 
        dagger from the wall, and surprises the pair in the dining room. 
        Because he does not wish to run after Troukhatchevsky without 
        shoes, Posdnicheff turns on his wife, and fatally 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">stabs</span> her. Although 
        jailed while awaiting trial, Posdnicheff is ultimately 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">acquitted</span> because of 
        his wife&#8217;s suspected infidelity.

	<li class="list_item">
        <span class="label">The Bet</span> (1889) by 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Anton Chekhov</span>. An old 
        banker recalls a bet that he made 15 years ago at a party, in 
        response to an argument about whether 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">capital punishment</span> is 
        more or less cruel than <span style="font-weight: bold;">life in 
        prison</span>. A lawyer suggests that life in prison is superior, 
        because it would be better to have some existence than none at all. 
        The rash banker bets <span style="font-weight: bold;">two million 
        roubles</span> that the lawyer would not last five years in 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">solitary confinement</span>; 
        the lawyer insists he could withstand 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">15 years</span>, and the bet is 
        on. The lawyer is often unhappy during the early years of his 
        confinement in a lodge on the banker&#8217;s estate. However, 
        the lawyer betters himself by refusing wine and tobacco, and 
        gradually studies languages, history, literature, philosophy, 
        the Bible, theology, and science. Meanwhile, the banker grows 
        steadily poorer, and realizes that paying off the bet will leave 
        him bankrupt. On the last day of the bet, the banker resolves 
        to kill the lawyer, and sneaks into the lodge while the 
        lawyer is sleeping. There, the banker finds a letter in which 
        the lawyer explains that years of study have taught him to 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">scorn earthly knowledge and 
        riches</span>, and to care only about the 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">salvation</span> of his soul. 
        The lawyer thus plans to leave the lodge 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">five hours before 12 
        o&#8217;clock</span> on November&nbsp;14, 1885, when he would 
        have won the bet. The banker departs without doing the lawyer 
        harm and the lawyer carries out his plan, allowing the banker to 
        avoid ruin. The banker then hides the lawyer&#8217;s note in a 
        safe, to avoid &#8220;unnecessary talk.&#8221;

	<li class="list_item">
        <span class="label">Ward No.&nbsp;6</span> (1892) by 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Anton Chekhov</span>. The story 
        is set in a run-down <span style="font-weight: bold;">asylum</span>, 
        whose five inmates include the university-educated 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Ivan Gromov</span> and the imbecilic 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Moiseika</span>. Moiseika is 
        the only inmate allowed to go into town, where he begs for items 
        that are all confiscated by <span style="font-weight: bold;">
        Nikita</span>, the asylum&#8217;s porter. The hospital is run by 
        the medical assistant <span style="font-weight: bold;">Sergei 
        Sergeyitch</span> and by the doctor <span style="font-weight: bold;">
        Andrei Yefimitch Ragin</span>, whose supervision gradually 
        becomes lax. Andrei discusses philosophical issues with the 
        postmaster <span style="font-weight: bold;">Mikhail Averyanich
        </span>, and later begins to engage in such conversations with 
        Ivan. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Dr. Yevgeny Hobotov</span>, 
        whom a local council appoints to work at the hospital, grows 
        concerned at Andrei&#8217;s long conversations with an inmate. 
        Fearing that Andrei is not well, Mikhail proposes that they 
        take a <span style="font-weight: bold;">trip</span> to Moscow, 
        Saint Petersburg, and Warsaw, but the journey goes poorly, and 
        Andrei spends most of his money paying off Mikhail&#8217;s 
        gambling debts.  Upon returning, Andrei finds out that he has 
        been fired and replaced by Dr. Hobotov. Andrei withdraws into 
        himself, and eventually shouts at Mikhail and Dr. Hobotov to 
        leave him alone. Dr. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Hobotov
        </span> tricks Andrei into entering Ward No. 6, where mental 
        patients are confined. When Andrei protests his incarceration, 
        Nikita beats him. Andrei soon dies of a stroke; Mikhail and 
        Andrei&#8217;s servant <span style="font-weight: bold;">Daryushka
        </span> are the only people at the funeral.

        <span class="label">The Lady with a Dog</span> (1899) by 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Anton Chekhov</span>. The 
        married banker <span style="font-weight: bold;">Dmitri Gurov
        </span> has been on vacation by himself in 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Yalta</span> for two weeks when 
        he hears of a &#8220;new face&#8221; attracting attention, a 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">lady with a dog</span>. Dmitri 
        meets the woman, <span style="font-weight: bold;">Anna Sergeyevna 
        von Diderits</span>. She is vacationing without her spouse, as 
        her marriage is unhappy&mdash;just like Dmitri&#8217;s. The two 
        sleep together. After returning to Moscow, Dmitri cannot forget 
        the memory of Anna, and realizes he has fallen in love. He 
        pretends to be going to Saint Petersburg for business, but 
        instead travels to Anna&#8217;s hometown. There, he finds her 
        at the debut of a play titled <i style="font-weight: bold;">
        The Geisha</i>. Dmitri confronts Anna at the performance, and she 
        confesses that she too has fallen in love. Anna begins making

        every few months to see Dmitri. The two fall deeper in love, 
        but do not know how to leave their marriages. The story ends on an 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">unresolved</span> note, stating 
        &#8220;to both of them it was clear that the end was still very 
        far off, and that their hardest and most difficult period was only 
        just beginning.&#8221;
